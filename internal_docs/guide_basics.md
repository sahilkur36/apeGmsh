# apeGmsh basics

A first-contact guide to working inside a apeGmsh session. This is the
document to read before `guide_parts_assembly.md` or `guide_meshing.md`:
it covers only the fundamentals — how a session starts, how geometry is
built, and how the OCC boolean operations (`fragment`, `fuse`,
`cut`/`intersect`) are used to get to a conformal, mesh-ready model.

The guide is grounded in the current source:

- `src/apeGmsh/_session.py` — session lifecycle (`begin`/`end`)
- `src/apeGmsh/_core.py` — the `apeGmsh` composite container
- `src/apeGmsh/core/Model.py` + `_model_geometry.py` + `_model_boolean.py`
  — geometry creation and boolean operations

All code snippets assume `from apeGmsh import apeGmsh`.


## 1. Why initialize? The session lifecycle

Gmsh is a C library with a single, process-wide state. Before any API
call you must hand control to that state with `gmsh.initialize()`, create
a named model with `gmsh.model.add(...)`, and eventually release the
state with `gmsh.finalize()`. Forgetting any of the three is the single
most common source of Gmsh errors.

apeGmsh wraps this lifecycle behind two calls on a session object, and
supports two equivalent usage patterns. Both produce the exact same
result — pick whichever fits the situation better.

**Pattern A — explicit `begin()` / `end()`.** Useful in notebooks when
you want to keep the session alive across several cells, in interactive
debugging, or when the session lifetime has to be controlled by
something other than a lexical block (e.g. a class `__init__` /
`__del__`, a Flask request, a test fixture).

```python
from apeGmsh import apeGmsh

g = apeGmsh(model_name="cantilever", verbose=True)
g.begin()   # gmsh.initialize() + gmsh.model.add("cantilever") + composite wiring

g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, label="beam")
g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=3)
# ... you can keep using g across many cells / function calls ...

g.end()     # gmsh.finalize()
```

With this pattern **you own the cleanup**. If an exception is raised
between `begin()` and `end()`, `gmsh.finalize()` never runs, and the
next call to `gmsh.initialize()` anywhere in the process will inherit
a polluted state. In a notebook, the symptom is that a perfectly
correct cell suddenly errors because of a previous cell's crash. Wrap
sensitive sections in `try / finally`:

```python
g = apeGmsh(model_name="cantilever")
g.begin()
try:
    g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, label="beam")
    g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=3)
finally:
    g.end()
```

**Pattern B — context manager (`with`).** The preferred form in scripts
and one-shot notebook cells. Equivalent to Pattern A wrapped in the
`try / finally` above: `__enter__` calls `begin()`, `__exit__` calls
`end()` no matter how the block exits.

```python
from apeGmsh import apeGmsh

with apeGmsh(model_name="cantilever", verbose=True) as g:
    g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, label="beam")
    g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=3)
# gmsh.finalize() runs here, even if the block raised
```

Both patterns go through the same `begin()` implementation, which does
three things in order:

1. Calls `gmsh.initialize()` and `gmsh.model.add(self.name)`.
2. Instantiates every composite listed in `apeGmsh._COMPOSITES` — `model`,
   `mesh`, `physical`, `mesh_selection`, `constraints`, `loads`,
   `opensees`, and so on — and attaches them as attributes on `g`.
   Those composites share a single `_metadata` dict (entity metadata
   like `kind`, cutting-plane normals, etc.) and `g.labels` (the
   label system backed by Gmsh physical groups).
3. Marks the session as active. Any composite method that touches gmsh
   asserts `g._active` first; this is what prevents the "I forgot
   `begin()`" footgun.

`end()` finalises the Gmsh state and marks the session inactive. After
`end()` the composites still exist, but calling anything on them will
raise — the Gmsh state they referenced is gone.

Rule of thumb: reach for `with` unless you have a concrete reason not
to. The explicit form is there for interactive work and for cases
where the session has to outlive a single code block.

A session always uses the **OpenCASCADE kernel** (`gmsh.model.occ`). The
built-in kernel (`gmsh.model.geo`) is intentionally not wrapped: the
meshing, constraints, and FEM layers assume OCC semantics (persistent
entity identity across boolean operations, accurate bounding boxes,
STEP/IGES I/O). Mixing kernels would break the metadata and label tracking.


## 2. Creating geometry

Geometry is created through `g.model`, which exposes the OCC kernel
behind a thin, self-documenting wrapper. Every `add_*` method:

- calls the underlying `gmsh.model.occ.add*` function,
- calls `gmsh.model.occ.synchronize()` unless `sync=False`,
- records entity metadata (`kind`) in `g.model._metadata`, and if
  `label=` was provided, creates a label PG via `g.labels`, and
- returns the **integer tag** of the new entity.

You therefore rarely touch `gmsh.model.occ` directly.

### Primitives

Solids, surfaces, curves, and points are available:

```python
with apeGmsh(model_name="demo") as g:
    # Points (dim = 0)
    p1 = g.model.geometry.add_point(0, 0, 0, mesh_size=0.1, label="origin")

    # Curves (dim = 1)
    p2 = g.model.geometry.add_point(1, 0, 0)
    line = g.model.geometry.add_line(p1, p2, label="bottom_edge")

    # Surfaces (dim = 2)
    plate = g.model.geometry.add_rectangle(0, 0, 0, 1.0, 0.5, label="plate")

    # Solids (dim = 3)
    box  = g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, label="beam")
    cyl  = g.model.geometry.add_cylinder(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 10, radius=0.3, label="core")
    sph  = g.model.geometry.add_sphere(0.5, 0.5, 5, radius=0.2, label="notch")
```

Two things are worth noting:

1. **Labels are the primary addressing mechanism in apeGmsh.** The raw
   integer tags are unstable — boolean operations (fragment, fuse, cut)
   can split one entity into several new tags. Labels survive all of
   this automatically. Always label anything you plan to reference
   later: a boundary condition surface, a constraint partner, a
   material region. See the **Labels** subsection below.

2. **`sync=True` is the default.** Each call synchronises OCC before
   returning, which is slow for large models. When you are building a
   batch of entities in a tight loop, pass `sync=False` to every call
   except the last one — the final `sync=True` flushes the whole batch
   to the kernel at once.

### Sketched geometry

For non-primitive shapes (an I-beam cross-section, a gusset plate, a
fillet profile) the pattern is the standard Gmsh sketch workflow, just
with apeGmsh wrappers:

```python
# 1. Points
pts = [g.model.geometry.add_point(x, y, 0, sync=False) for x, y in coords]
# 2. Lines closing the contour
lns = [g.model.geometry.add_line(pts[i], pts[(i + 1) % len(pts)], sync=False)
       for i in range(len(pts))]
# 3. Curve loop -> surface
loop = g.model.geometry.add_curve_loop(lns, sync=False)
face = g.model.geometry.add_plane_surface([loop], label="I_web")
# 4. Extrude to a solid if needed (use gmsh.model.occ.extrude + re-register)
```

Extrusion, revolution, and transforms are exposed via
`g.model.transforms.extrude(...)`, `g.model.transforms.translate(...)`, `g.model.transforms.rotate(...)`,
and friends on `_model_transforms.py`. They follow the same
label + registry conventions as the primitives.


### Labels — naming geometry for the rest of the pipeline

Every `add_*` call accepts an optional `label=` parameter. This single
string is the thread that connects geometry creation to meshing,
physical groups, constraints, loads, and solver export. Understanding
how it works is essential.

**What happens when you write `label="shaft"`:**

1. A **Gmsh physical group** is created behind the scenes with the
   name `_label:shaft`. This is invisible to the solver and to
   `g.physical` — it is purely geometry-time bookkeeping.
2. That physical group is the **single source of truth** for label
   resolution.  `g.labels.entities("shaft")` queries it and returns
   the current entity tags, even if tags were renumbered by a boolean
   operation.

**Labels survive boolean operations.** Every `fragment`, `fuse`,
`cut`, and `intersect` call snapshots all physical groups before the
operation and remaps their entity membership through the OCC result
map afterward. You never need to re-resolve labels manually.

```python
box = g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, label="shaft")
# box == 1 (an integer tag)

plane = g.model.geometry.add_axis_cutting_plane('z', offset=1.5)
top, bot = g.model.geometry.cut_by_plane(box, plane)
# box tag 1 is gone — replaced by top=[2] and bot=[3]

# But the label still works:
g.labels.entities("shaft")  # -> [2, 3] — both fragments
```

**Labels vs physical groups (two tiers):**

| | Labels (`g.labels`) | Physical groups (`g.physical`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Geometry bookkeeping | Solver-facing naming |
| **Created by** | `label=` on `add_*` methods | Explicit user call |
| **Gmsh name** | `_label:name` (hidden prefix) | `name` (no prefix) |
| **Visible to solver** | No | Yes |
| **Survives booleans** | Yes | Yes |

Labels are the working names you use during model construction.
Physical groups are the names the solver sees. Promote a label to
a physical group when you are ready:

```python
# After geometry + booleans are done:
g.labels.promote_to_physical("shaft", pg_name="ColumnShaft")
# or create a PG directly:
g.physical.add_volume([tag1, tag2], name="ColumnShaft")
```

**In multi-part assemblies**, labels are prefixed with the instance
name. If a Part has a label `"bottom"` and you create two instances:

```python
inst_A = g.parts.add(column, label="col_A")
inst_B = g.parts.add(column, label="col_B")

inst_A.labels.bottom   # -> "col_A.bottom"
inst_B.labels.bottom   # -> "col_B.bottom"

g.labels.entities(inst_A.labels.bottom)  # -> tags for A's bottom surface
g.labels.entities(inst_B.labels.bottom)  # -> tags for B's bottom surface
```

Labels travel through STEP round-trips via a JSON sidecar file
(`*.step.apegmsh.json`) that stores center-of-mass anchors for each
labeled entity. On reimport, entities are matched by geometric
proximity rather than tag numbers (which STEP does not preserve).

**Querying with labels and PG names directly.** Most query and resolver
methods accept labels and physical-group names anywhere they accept a
tag. `g.model.queries.boundary(...)` is a representative example: it
resolves a string as a label first (Tier 1, `g.labels`), then as a
physical-group name (Tier 2, `g.physical`):

```python
g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, label="shaft")

# All three forms work:
faces = g.model.queries.boundary("shaft")          # label
faces = g.model.queries.boundary("ColumnShaft")    # PG name (after promotion)
faces = g.model.queries.boundary([(3, 1)])         # raw DimTag (discouraged)
```

This means you almost never need to materialise raw tags by hand.
Build geometry with `label=`, then pass the label string straight to
boundary, fragment, fuse, cut, intersect, constraint, load, and mass
APIs. The dispatch happens in `_resolve_to_dimtags` — the same
mechanism the boolean operations use.


## 3. OCC operations: fragment, fuse, cut, intersect

Once you have more than one body in the model you are almost always
going to need a boolean operation. apeGmsh exposes four of them on
`g.model`, all implemented in `core/_model_boolean.py` through a single
internal helper `_bool_op` that:

- resolves integer tags to `DimTag`s (so you can pass labels or bare
  tags interchangeably),
- calls the matching `gmsh.model.occ.*` function,
- synchronises,
- cleans up the registry (consumed entities are removed; surviving
  ones are re-registered), and
- returns a `list[Tag]` of the surviving entities at the target
  dimension.

### fuse — union (A ∪ B)

`g.model.boolean.fuse(objects, tools)` merges bodies into one. Use this when
two parts are geometrically the *same material* and you don't care
about the interface between them — the classic example is gluing a
haunch onto a beam flange.

```python
beam    = g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 10, 0.3, 0.5)
haunch  = g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.3, 0.3)
merged  = g.model.boolean.fuse(beam, haunch)        # -> [one volume tag]
```

After `fuse`, the interface surface between the two boxes is *gone*.
You cannot recover it, so you cannot put a physical group, a BC, or a
tie constraint on it. If you need the interface, use `fragment`
instead.

### cut — difference (A − B)

`g.model.boolean.cut(objects, tools)` removes the tool from the object. This
is how you drill bolt holes, carve notches, or subtract a void region
from a soil block.

```python
block  = g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)
hole   = g.model.geometry.add_cylinder(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 1, radius=0.1)
block2 = g.model.boolean.cut(block, hole)            # block with a through-hole
```

### intersect — intersection (A ∩ B)

`g.model.boolean.intersect(objects, tools)` keeps only the overlap region.
This is useful for clipping one shape to the bounding volume of
another — for example, clipping a soil layer to a site footprint.

### fragment — split at intersections (keep everything)

`g.model.boolean.fragment(objects, tools)` is the most important one for FEM
work, and the one that trips people up first.

`fragment` computes all intersections between `objects` and `tools`
and then *splits every body at those intersections* without throwing
anything away. The result is a collection of sub-volumes (and
sub-surfaces, and sub-curves) that **share coincident topology**
wherever they touch — no gaps, no overlaps, no duplicated nodes.
This is the geometric precondition for a conformal mesh across a
multi-body model.

```python
soil     = g.model.geometry.add_box(-5, -5, -5, 10, 10, 5, label="soil")
footing  = g.model.geometry.add_box(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 1, label="footing")

# Fragment the soil against the footing. Both bodies survive, but
# the soil now has a matching face where the footing sits.
pieces = g.model.boolean.fragment(soil, footing)
```

Because fragmenting can multiply entities, raw integer tags become
unreliable after the call. **Labels survive automatically**: every
boolean operation (`fragment`, `fuse`, `cut`, `intersect`) preserves
label and physical-group membership by remapping entity tags through
the result map. After a fragment you can keep using
`g.labels.entities("soil")` and it will return the correct (possibly
expanded) set of tags.

`fragment` also does a small post-processing step. If the operation
leaves free-floating surface fragments — for example a cutting plane
that extended past the solid — it removes them when
`cleanup_free=True` (the default). Set it to `False` if you
deliberately want to keep those surfaces for a boundary condition or
a selection set.

### Choosing between fragment and fuse — the conformal question

This is the decision you need to make for every multi-body model:

| You want…                                                      | Use       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Two bodies merged into one material region                    | `fuse`    |
| Two bodies sharing a mesh-conformal interface, still separate | `fragment`|
| Two bodies remaining independent, tied with constraints       | neither   |

"Mesh-conformal" means the mesher produces a single set of nodes on
the shared face, so both bodies reference the same DOFs there. Without
`fragment`, each body would mesh its face independently and you would
end up with two unconnected node clouds that happen to be coincident
in space — a silent, catastrophic modelling error.

The rule of thumb in this project: **if two parts touch and should
transmit force through the contact, fragment them**. If they should
transmit force through an elastic or rigid link instead, leave them
alone and add a constraint in `g.constraints`.


## 4. Worked example: soil block + footing + column

End-to-end script showing initialization, geometry, and the three
OCC operations working together. The goal is a soil block with a
footing embedded in its top and a column rising out of the footing,
all prepared for a conformal mesh.

### 4a. Context-manager form (scripts, one-shot cells)

```python
from apeGmsh import apeGmsh

with apeGmsh(model_name="ssi_demo", verbose=True) as g:

    # --- Bodies ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Soil: 10 x 10 x 5 block with its top at z = 0
    soil    = g.model.geometry.add_box(-5, -5, -5, 10, 10, 5, label="soil")

    # Footing: 2 x 2 x 1 block, top flush with soil surface
    footing = g.model.geometry.add_box(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 1, label="footing")

    # Column stub above the footing (two halves that we will fuse)
    col_low  = g.model.geometry.add_box(-0.15, -0.15, 0,    0.3, 0.3, 1.0)
    col_high = g.model.geometry.add_box(-0.15, -0.15, 1.0,  0.3, 0.3, 2.0)

    # --- Fuse: two column segments become one body ---------------------
    column = g.model.boolean.fuse(col_low, col_high)
    # The interface at z = 1.0 is erased. Good: the column is one
    # homogeneous piece of concrete with no artificial seam.

    # --- Fragment: make soil + footing + column conformal --------------
    # Any order works; fragment is symmetric in objects/tools except
    # for the order of surviving tags.
    pieces = g.model.boolean.fragment(soil, [footing] + column)
    # After this call:
    #   - soil has a matching face with the footing bottom
    #   - footing has a matching face with the column base
    #   - no entity overlaps, no gaps, no free surfaces

    # --- Physical groups (for materials + BCs) -------------------------
    # Labels still resolve because fragment updated the registry.
    g.physical.add_from_label("soil",    name="Soil",    dim=3)
    g.physical.add_from_label("footing", name="Footing", dim=3)
    g.physical.add_from_label("column",  name="Column",  dim=3)

    # --- Mesh ----------------------------------------------------------
    g.mesh.sizing.set_size_global(0.5)
    g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=3)

    # At this point the three volumes share nodes across their
    # fragment-generated interfaces; OpenSees will see a single
    # connected assembly.
```

### 4b. Explicit `begin()` / `end()` form (notebooks, multi-cell work)

The same model, written so the session stays open across what would
typically be several notebook cells. This is the pattern to use when
you want to inspect `g.model.queries.registry()` between steps, call
`g.plot.show()` mid-build, or re-run just the meshing cell without
rebuilding the geometry.

```python
from apeGmsh import apeGmsh

# --- Cell 1: open the session --------------------------------------------
g = apeGmsh(model_name="ssi_demo", verbose=True)
g.begin()

try:
    # --- Cell 2: build the bodies ----------------------------------------
    soil    = g.model.geometry.add_box(-5, -5, -5, 10, 10, 5, label="soil")
    footing = g.model.geometry.add_box(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 1,   label="footing")
    col_low  = g.model.geometry.add_box(-0.15, -0.15, 0,   0.3, 0.3, 1.0)
    col_high = g.model.geometry.add_box(-0.15, -0.15, 1.0, 0.3, 0.3, 2.0)

    # --- Cell 3: fuse the column halves ---------------------------------
    column = g.model.boolean.fuse(col_low, col_high)

    # --- Cell 4: fragment the whole assembly ----------------------------
    pieces = g.model.boolean.fragment(soil, [footing] + column)

    # --- Cell 5: physical groups + mesh ---------------------------------
    g.physical.add_from_label("soil",    name="Soil",    dim=3)
    g.physical.add_from_label("footing", name="Footing", dim=3)
    g.physical.add_from_label("column",  name="Column",  dim=3)

    g.mesh.sizing.set_size_global(0.5)
    g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=3)

finally:
    # --- Final cell: release the Gmsh state ------------------------------
    g.end()
```

The `try / finally` around the body is what makes this pattern safe in
a notebook: if any cell raises, the `finally` block still runs and
cleans up the Gmsh state, so the next session you open starts from a
clean slate. If you skip the `try / finally`, remember to run `g.end()`
manually before re-running the "open the session" cell — otherwise the
second `gmsh.initialize()` call will fight with the first.

The three OCC operations each play a distinct role here:

- `fuse` on the two column segments is cosmetic — it removes an
  unnecessary internal face so the column is a single body.
- `fragment` on the full trio is structural — it enforces conformal
  topology so the mesher can produce a single, connected FEM model.
- `cut` and `intersect` did not appear, but they would come in if the
  soil block had a void (say, a buried tunnel: `cut(soil, tunnel)`)
  or if the footing had to be trimmed to a site polygon
  (`intersect(footing, site)`).

### When not to fragment

Fragmenting a 5000-entity assembly is expensive. If your bodies are
either (a) truly disjoint in space, or (b) intended to be tied with
`equalDOF` / rigid links rather than sharing nodes, skip `fragment`
and handle the coupling in `g.constraints` instead. The meshing guide
(`guide_meshing.md`) covers that path.
