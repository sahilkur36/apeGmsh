"""S3a (P3-R) — the entity-family ``g.model.select(...)`` terminal.

Phase S3a of the selection-unification work
(``docs/plans/selection-unification.md`` §5/§6, ratified decision R3),
carried through selection-unification-v2 P3-R
(``docs/plans/selection-unification-v2.md`` §6.2 / §6.3): the
fluent, daisy-chainable entity-family terminal ``EntitySelection``
(the legacy ``GeometryChain`` is deleted) is reached via the
``g.model.select(...)`` host hook and materialises the RETAINED legacy
``core/_selection.Selection`` terminal (R-v2-8).

What this locks:

* ``g.model.select(...)`` returns an ``EntitySelection`` and delegates
  name resolution to the contract-locked geometry resolver
  (``resolve_to_dimtags``) — label -> PG -> part tiering, not
  re-implemented here.
* The chain daisy-chains: ``.select(...).in_box(...).on_plane(...)``
  composes, every verb returning a new ``EntitySelection``.
* Entity-family spatial semantics:
    - ``in_box`` uses ``gmsh.model.getEntitiesInBoundingBox`` (BRep
      bbox-INTERSECT — Gmsh's own entity query), NOT coordinate
      half-open;
    - ``inclusive=`` (any keyword) raises ``TypeError`` — the
      half-open knob is inexpressible for the BRep query (R3, fail
      loud, never silently ignored);
    - ``on_plane`` reuses the legacy ``Plane`` / ``_bb_corners``
      8-corner "on" test;
    - ``in_sphere`` / ``nearest_to`` / ``where`` operate on the entity
      bounding-box centre.
* Set algebra ``| & - ^`` with insertion-order dedup; cross-type
  combination is loud.
* ``.result()`` returns a **legacy** ``core/_selection.Selection``
  instance (the class is RETAINED — R-v2-8), so ``.to_label()`` /
  ``.to_physical()`` / ``.tags()`` keep working through the unchanged
  terminal.
* The geometric-predicate engine is now reached through the v2
  ``g.model.select(...).crossing_plane(spec, mode=)`` verb (the legacy
  ``g.model.queries.select`` / ``g.model.selection.select_*`` entry
  points are removed by P3-R); the two RETAINED ``Selection`` classes
  (``core/_selection.Selection`` list-subclass vs ``viz`` frozen) stay
  irreconcilable and distinct (FP-2 / R-v2-8).

No ``openseespy`` dependency (curated no-openseespy CI gate): pure
apeGmsh + gmsh + numpy.  A tiny unit cube with a 6-face physical group
is the deterministic fixture.
