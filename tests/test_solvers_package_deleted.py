"""Phase 8.8 — verify ``apeGmsh.solvers`` is fully gone.

After the multi-phase Phase 8 untangle (8.1 through 8.7) every name
that used to live under ``apeGmsh.solvers`` was relocated to its
canonical home elsewhere — broker records under ``apeGmsh.mesh``,
bridge primitives under ``apeGmsh.opensees``, recorder spec types
under ``apeGmsh.results.spec``. Phase 8.8 deletes the package
entirely.

These tests verify the Phase 8 acceptance criteria from
``phase-8-untangle.md``:

- ``apeGmsh/solvers/`` directory is empty / deleted.
- ``git grep \"from apeGmsh.solvers\" src/`` returns zero matches.
- ``git grep \"from apeGmsh.solvers\" tests/`` returns zero matches.

The filesystem check (``solvers/`` directory absence) is the
authoritative one — it works in any environment regardless of
which apeGmsh install Python happens to resolve. The import
check is a belt-and-suspenders sanity gate that fires once the
deletion lands on every install path.
