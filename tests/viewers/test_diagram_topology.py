"""Pin the per-kind topology mapping.

PR 1 collapsed two sources of truth (the dialog's hand-written
``_KIND_TO_TOPOLOGY`` dict and each diagram subclass's composite-reader
calls) into one: a class-level ``topology`` attribute on each Diagram.
The dialog now derives its dict from that attribute. These tests guard
the eight existing kinds so a future rename can't silently re-open the
drift.
