"""Reflection-driven parity between record dataclasses and their H5
payload dtypes.

This is the regression test class that would have caught the gap
fixed by PR #337 (ADR 0035 follow-up): :class:`InterpolationRecord`
gained four ASDEmbeddedNodeElement option fields
(``stiffness`` / ``stiffness_p`` / ``rotational`` / ``pressure``)
plus ``excess``, but the kernel H5 schema
:func:`interpolation_payload_dtype` silently dropped them.  Round-
trip through ``g.save()`` → ``FEMData.from_h5(...)`` reverted those
fields to dataclass defaults; the bridge then emitted ``-K 1e18``
unconditionally regardless of what the user set.

The fix landed in #337 by extending the dtype.  This file adds the
*structural* check that locks the invariant for every record type
going forward: every dataclass field appears as a payload dtype
column, modulo a whitelist of fields whose absence from the
payload dtype is documented and intentional (e.g. CSR-flattened
sub-records, group-hierarchy keys).

The pattern is symmetric: when a new field is added to a record
dataclass, this test fails with a message that names the missing
column.  The author then either adds the column (the usual case)
or adds the field to the whitelist with a one-line reason (the
rare intentional case).  Whitelist additions are reviewed.
