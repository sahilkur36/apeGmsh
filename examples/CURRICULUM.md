# apeGmsh Learning Curriculum

**Status: APPROVED — in execution.**

Execution decisions:

* Notebooks live alongside the existing EOS examples in
  `examples/EOS Examples/`, numbered with a `NN_` prefix so they sort
  together at the top of the directory listing.
* Verification is **printed inline** — each notebook ends with a cell
  that shows ``FEM result  | Analytical  | Error %`` so the learner
  sees the number on every run. No ``assert`` statements (keeps
  notebooks from failing for cosmetic mesh-refinement mismatches).
* Going all-in on the full 19-slot curriculum.
* **OpenSees is exercised natively** — notebooks call ``openseespy``
  directly (``ops.node``, ``ops.element``, ``ops.fix``,
  ``ops.analyze``, …). apeGmsh is used only for geometry, meshing,
  physical-group tagging, and the ``FEMData`` broker. The
  ``g.opensees.*`` composite is intentionally skipped so learners
  see the solver calls explicitly.

This document is the planning spec for a structured learning path
through apeGmsh, OpenSees-first. Every example ends with
``ops.analyze()`` and at least one extracted result, verified against
either an analytical solution or a published benchmark.

The curriculum preserves every existing notebook. Nothing is deleted
or renamed. Slots that already have an existing notebook either
**ADAPT** it (copy → verify against current library → fix whatever
has drifted → save as the curriculum version) or mark it **NEW** when
no existing notebook is close enough.

> ### Health warning about existing notebooks
>
> Several notebooks under `examples/` were written against earlier
> versions of the composite APIs (`NodeResult` before pair-iter,
> `MeshViewerV2`, constraint records before the `_kinds` split, …).
> **They are not assumed to run as-is.** Every curriculum notebook
> — even those derived from an existing file — is executed end-to-end
> against `HEAD` before being accepted into the curriculum. Where an
> existing notebook covers the right topic but uses stale APIs, it is
> still valuable as a starting point: the engineering setup (geometry,
> section properties, loads) rarely needs to change, only the
> apeGmsh calls that consume/produce composite records.

## How to read this document

Each row in a tier table has:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **#** | Curriculum ordinal (01..19). |
| **Title** | Short descriptive name (what the learner sees in the README). |
| **File** | Notebook path. Prefix: `NEW` = to be written from scratch. `ADAPT` = existing notebook is a starting point; verify + fix stale APIs + save under `examples/EOS Examples/`. `REVIEW` = existing file likely fits but I need to read it before confirming the classification. No "reuse as-is" column — every existing notebook is treated as a draft. |
| **Learns** | Single-sentence learning objective. |
| **Features** | apeGmsh features introduced (comma-separated). |
| **Analysis** | OpenSees analysis type (static / eigen / static_nonlinear / transient). |
| **Verify** | How correctness is checked (analytical, benchmark, cross-code). |
| **Prereq** | Earliest preceding example the learner must have done. |

See the _Summary of authoring work_ section at the bottom for the
counts of NEW vs ADAPT slots and the total effort estimate.

## Tier 1 — Fundamentals

Goal: a new user can build, mesh, solve, and extract results from a
linear-elastic model in under 100 lines. Every example here has a
closed-form answer.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Hello Plate | ADAPT `examples/EOS Examples/example_plate_basic.ipynb` | The full apeGmsh pipeline: `g.model` → `g.mesh` → `FEMData` → OpenSees → displacement. | geometry primitives, physical groups, `fix`, nodal load, direct `ops.*` ingest, `ops.analyze("Static")` | static linear | Max displacement within 1% of Timoshenko plate theory or analytical beam strip. | — |

## Tier 2 — Model building blocks

Goal: the learner sees each major composite (`labels`, `physical`,
`sections`, `loads`, `masses`, `mesh.sizing`) in isolation so they
know where each concept lives.

| # | Title | File | Learns | Features | Analysis | Verify | Prereq |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 05 | Labels and Physical Groups | **NEW** `examples/EOS Examples/05_labels_and_pgs.ipynb` | When to use labels (Tier 1) vs PGs (Tier 2); how both feed load/BC targeting. | `g.model.labels.*`, `g.physical.*`, auto-resolution precedence in `g.loads.point(target=)` | static linear | Identical result whether the target is given as a label, a PG, or a raw DimTag list. | 02 |
| 06 | Section Catalog | ADAPT `examples/moment_curvature_fiber_section.ipynb` + short section-catalog prelude | Fiber sections (concrete + rebar), elastic sections, shell sections; moment-curvature response. | `ops.section`, `ops.patch`, `ops.layer`, `ops.uniaxialMaterial`, moment-curvature driver | static nonlinear (section only) | Cracked/uncracked stiffness ratio matches hand calc; yield moment within 2%. | 02 |

## Tier 3 — Assemblies

Goal: the learner can compose multi-instance models from parts, do
boolean operations safely, and tie conformal interfaces.

| 11 | Boolean Operations in Assemblies | REVIEW `examples/example_gusset.ipynb` — does it use `g.model.boolean` with parts? If not, **NEW**. | `fuse`, `cut`, `fragment` applied to imported CAD, staying part-aware. | `g.model.io.load_step`, `g.model.boolean.*`, `g.parts.fragment_all` | static linear | Assembled geometry passes `make_conformal` without orphans. | 10 |
| 12 | Interfaces via Tie | **NEW** `examples/EOS Examples/12_interfaces_via_tie.ipynb` | Two parts meshed separately, tied at a shared surface; the `tie` constraint resolver in action. | `g.constraints.tie`, `InterpolationRecord`, shape-function weights | static linear | Displacement continuity across the interface within mesh-size tolerance. | 10 |

**Tier 3 gaps to write:** 2 fully new (10, 12) + 1 review (11).

## Tier 4 — Mixed-dimension and contact

Goal: the learner can couple beam-to-solid, add contact springs,
embed rebar, and tie non-matching meshes — the four hardest
real-world interface problems.

## Tier 5 — Analysis types

Goal: the learner can run every analysis type OpenSees exposes:
modal, buckling, pushover, and time-history.

| # | Title | File | Learns | Features | Analysis | Verify | Prereq |

## Summary of authoring work

| Category | Count | Which |
|---|---|---|
| Full new notebooks (write from scratch) | 10 | 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, 08, 10, 12, 16, 20 |
| Adapt an existing notebook (copy → verify against HEAD → fix stale API → save under `curriculum/`) | 8 | 01, 06, 09, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 |
| Needs review before deciding NEW vs ADAPT | 1 | 11 |
| **Total curriculum slots** | **19** | |

Adapting is **not** free work — early-composite-API drift is real and
every existing notebook will need its constraint/load/viewer calls
updated. Budget ~1-2 hours for a mature ADAPT slot (e.g. 13, 17) and
2-3 hours for one where the engineering side also needs a refresh
(e.g. 09, 19). Budget 2-4 hours per NEW slot.

Rough total effort: **~50-65 hours** of authoring. At one session per
week, that's ~10-12 weeks.

## Executing the curriculum

Proposed ordering for writing sessions:

1. **Session 1 (Tier 1):** Write 02, 03, 04. Three small analytical examples; establishes the template every later notebook follows.
2. **Session 2 (Tier 2, part 1):** Write 05, 07, 08. The pure-apeGmsh composite tutorials.
3. **Session 3 (Tier 2, part 2):** Polish 06 and 09. Minimal touches on existing notebooks.
4. **Session 4 (Tier 3):** Write 10, 12. Review 11.
5. **Session 5 (Tier 4 closure):** Write 16.
6. **Session 6 (Tier 5 closure):** Write 20.
7. **Session 7 (integration):** Write `examples/README.md` that ties the whole curriculum together with links and a prerequisite diagram.

Each session keeps CLAUDE.md's surgical discipline: one notebook per commit, follow the template established in 02, verify every analytical claim before shipping.

## Template for a curriculum notebook

Every NEW notebook follows this 8-section structure so learners know
what to expect:

1. **Problem statement** — a paragraph and a sketch. State the
   analytical answer up front.
2. **Geometry** — minimal Gmsh geometry using `g.model.geometry.*`.
3. **Physical groups / labels** — tag what loads and BCs will
   attach to.
4. **Mesh** — one or two parameter sweeps, not a convergence study
   (that lives in 09).
5. **FEM build** — sections, loads, constraints, masses.
6. **OpenSees ingest + analysis** — **native** ``openseespy`` calls
   (``ops.node``, ``ops.element``, ``ops.fix``, ``ops.load``), driven
   by ``fem.nodes.get(...)`` / ``fem.elements.get(...)`` iteration
   over the ``FEMData`` broker. The apeGmsh OpenSees composite
   (``g.opensees.*``) is **not** used in the curriculum — every
   notebook shows what the underlying openseespy calls look like.
7. **Result extraction** — pull the specific number the problem
   statement named, compute error vs the analytical/benchmark
   reference.
8. **Viewer check (optional)** — `g.mesh.results_viewer(...)` with a
   one-line "here's what you should see".

The verification cell (section 7) follows this exact format so a
reader can compare across notebooks::

    print(f"FEM result :  {fem_value:.6e}  {units}")
    print(f"Analytical :  {analytical_value:.6e}  {units}")
    print(f"Error      :  {err_pct:.4f} %")
