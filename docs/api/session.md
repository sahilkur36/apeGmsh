# Session — `apeGmsh`

The top-level session object. Owns a single Gmsh kernel and wires
all composites (`model`, `mesh`, `parts`, `constraints`, `loads`,
`masses`, …). The OpenSees bridge is **not** a session composite —
import it explicitly via `from apeGmsh.opensees import apeSees`.

## Native persistence

The session can persist the **neutral zone** (the solver-agnostic
`FEMData` snapshot — nodes, elements, physical groups, labels,
loads, masses, constraints) to a native `model.h5`. Two write
paths are exposed on the session:

```python
# Autosave: write the neutral zone on context-manager exit
with apeGmsh(model_name="Tower", save_to="model.h5") as g:
    g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, label="body")
    g.physical.add_volume("body", name="body")
    g.mesh.generation.generate(3)
# model.h5 now exists

# Manual: write at any point inside the session
with apeGmsh(model_name="Tower") as g:
    ...
    g.save("model.h5")        # explicit path
```

`apeGmsh(save_to=..., overwrite=True)` configures autosave at
construction; the file is written on `end()` / context exit.
`overwrite=False` makes a pre-existing target fail-loud on save.
`g.save(path=None)` writes immediately and returns the resolved
`Path`; with no argument it reuses `save_to`, and raises
`RuntimeError` if neither a path nor `save_to` was supplied.

Both paths write the **neutral zone only**. The OpenSees zone
(typed primitives, recorders, analysis chain) is written
separately by the bridge via `apeSees(fem).h5(path)` — see the
[OpenSees bridge](opensees.md) page.

### Chain-phase reassembly

`apeGmsh.from_h5(path, *, model_name=None, verbose=False)` rebuilds
a session **directly from a `model.h5`**, skipping the Gmsh build
entirely. The returned session is a *chain-phase* session: it has
no live kernel, so geometry/meshing verbs are unavailable, but it
can still `compose`, `save`, and feed the bridge.

```python
g = apeGmsh.from_h5("model.h5")        # no gmsh; loads the neutral zone
ops = apeSees(g.mesh.queries.get_fem_data(dim=3))
```

## Composition

`g.compose(source, *, label, ...)` merges another saved module's
`model.h5` into the current session under a namespaced `label`,
applying an optional rigid placement (`translate`, `rotate`,
`anchor`) and reserving a disjoint tag span so child tags never
collide ([ADR 0038](https://github.com/nmorabowen/apeGmsh/blob/main/src/apeGmsh/opensees/architecture/decisions/0038-compose-model-composition.md)).
It returns a `ComposedModule` handle.

```python
with apeGmsh.from_h5("frame.h5") as g:
    g.compose("panel.h5", label="Panel_A", translate=(0, 0, 3.0))
    g.compose("panel.h5", label="Panel_B", translate=(0, 0, 6.0))
    g.compose_list()                 # -> (ComposedModule, ...)
    g.compose_tree()                 # nested-compose hierarchy
```

Inspect a candidate file **without** composing via
`g.compose_inspect(path)` (returns a dict: `fem_hash`,
`neutral_schema_version`, `tag_span_max`, `pg_inventory`,
`label_inventory`, `record_counts`, `compose_tree`, …).
`g.compose_list()` enumerates the modules already composed into
this session; `g.compose_tree()` returns the nested-compose
hierarchy. In the viewer, composed parts are colourable by the
string-keyed Module modes (`'Module'`, `'Module: Root'`,
`'Module: Leaf'`).

### Declarative assembly — `Assembly` + `couple`

To spatially couple several saved `model.h5` modules without
hand-wiring `compose` + constraints, use the declarative builder
(shipped in v2.0.0, [ADR 0043](https://github.com/nmorabowen/apeGmsh/blob/main/src/apeGmsh/opensees/architecture/decisions/0043-connectivity-graph-and-flexible-emit.md)
slice 1.4). It is imported from a **sub-path** — `apeGmsh.Assembly`
is intentionally not exported, so the top-level "the session *is* the
assembly" model is unchanged.

```python
from apeGmsh.assembly import Assembly

g = (
    Assembly("frame")
    .add("col", "col.h5")                               # first add = host (bare PGs)
    .add("beam", "beam.h5", translate=(0.0, 3.0, 0.0))  # composed under label "beam"
    .couple("col", "beam", kind="equal_dof",
            ports=("top", "end"), dofs=[1, 2, 3])
    .materialize()                                      # -> composed apeGmsh session
)
g.save("frame.h5")
```

`materialize()` is a thin wrapper over `apeGmsh.from_h5` (host) +
`g.compose` (each later part) + `g.constraints.<kind>`. Couple `kind`
is `equal_dof` or `tied_contact`; `ports` are **bare** per-part
physical-group names. A couple that resolves to zero constraints, an
unknown part, or no parts raises `AssemblyError`.
