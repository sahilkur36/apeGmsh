# Save it, reload it, view it

You already know how to build a model, solve it, and read a number back —
that's [T1](first-model.md) and [T3](#). This tutorial is the *day-two*
workflow nobody shows you: you built the model on Monday, the OpenSees run
takes an hour, and on Tuesday you want to reopen the thing, re-solve from
exactly where you left off, and look at the deformed shape in your notebook
without the kernel dying.

So we don't introduce a single new piece of mechanics. We take the
[simply-supported beam from T3](#) — the *same* span, section, support, and
load — and learn three things instead:

1. how a session **saves itself to a native `.h5`** when the `with` block
   closes,
2. how `FEMData.from_h5` **reloads** that file with an integrity check, and
3. why `Results` needs a `model=`, and which viewer is **safe to call in a
   notebook**.

The check at the end is the whole point of persistence: the *reloaded*
model has to reproduce the T3 midspan deflection **identically** — not
close, identically — and the file's content hash has to prove nothing got
corrupted on the round-trip.

## The problem (a quick recap from T3)

```
                 P = 20 kN  (downward)
                          |
                          v
       ●===================●===================●
      △                  (mid)                 ○
   pin (ux, uy)                          roller (uy)
       |<------ L/2 ------>|<------ L/2 ------>|
       |<--------------- L = 4 m ------------->|

  Section: 0.10 m × 0.20 m rectangle (strong-axis bending)
  Material: steel, E = 200 GPa
```

A central point load on a simply-supported beam has a midspan deflection
straight out of the textbook:

$$
\delta_{\text{mid}} \;=\; \frac{P\,L^{3}}{48\,E\,I}
$$

With $P = 20{,}000\ \text{N}$, $L = 4\ \text{m}$,
$E = 200\times10^{9}\ \text{Pa}$, and
$I = \tfrac{b h^{3}}{12} = \tfrac{0.10 \cdot 0.20^{3}}{12} = 6.667\times10^{-5}\ \text{m}^4$:

$$
\delta_{\text{mid}} \;=\; \frac{20{,}000 \cdot 4^{3}}{48 \cdot 200\times10^{9} \cdot 6.667\times10^{-5}}
\;=\; 2.00\times10^{-3}\ \text{m} \;=\; 2.00\ \text{mm}
$$

Keep **2.00 mm** in your back pocket. This is the number the model has to
give us *after it has been to disk and back*.

!!! note "Units"
    As always, consistent SI — metres, newtons, pascals. The deflection
    comes out in metres.

## The whole script

Here is the entire thing. Read it top to bottom — the new lines are the
persistence ones (`save_to=`, `FEMData.from_h5`); everything else you've
seen in T1 and T3. We walk through it block by block right after.

```python
from apeGmsh import apeGmsh, FEMData, Results
from apeGmsh.opensees import apeSees, OpenSeesModel
from apeGmsh.results.capture.spec import DomainCaptureSpec

# --- Problem data (consistent SI: m, N, Pa) ---
L  = 4.0          # span           [m]
E  = 200e9        # Young's mod.    [Pa]  (steel)
b, h = 0.10, 0.20 # section sides   [m]
A  = b * h                  # area            [m^2]
Iz = b * h**3 / 12.0        # strong-axis I   [m^4]
P  = 20_000.0     # midspan load    [N]  (downward, -y)

# --- 1. Build the model AND autosave it to a native .h5 on exit ---
with apeGmsh(model_name="ssbeam", save_to="ssbeam.h5", overwrite=True) as g:
    p0 = g.model.geometry.add_point(0.0,   0.0, 0.0)
    pm = g.model.geometry.add_point(L/2.0, 0.0, 0.0)   # split at midspan
    p1 = g.model.geometry.add_point(L,     0.0, 0.0)
    sl = g.model.geometry.add_line(p0, pm)
    sr = g.model.geometry.add_line(pm, p1)
    g.model.sync()

    g.physical.add(1, [sl, sr], name="Beam")     # the two curves -> elements
    g.physical.add(0, [p0], name="Pin")          # left support
    g.physical.add(0, [p1], name="Roller")       # right support
    g.physical.add(0, [pm], name="Mid")          # load + readout node

    g.mesh.sizing.set_global_size(L / 16.0)
    g.mesh.generation.generate(1)
    fem = g.mesh.queries.get_fem_data()          # full snapshot (every dim)
    snap_built = fem.snapshot_id                 # remember its content hash
    # ssbeam.h5 is written HERE, as the `with` block exits.

print(f"built    snapshot_id = {snap_built}")

# --- 2. Reload the model from disk — integrity-checked ---
fem2 = FEMData.from_h5("ssbeam.h5")
print(f"reloaded snapshot_id = {fem2.snapshot_id}")
print(f"hash match           = {fem2.snapshot_id == snap_built}")

# --- 3. Build + solve OpenSees from the RELOADED snapshot ---
ops = apeSees(fem2)
ops.model(ndm=2, ndf=3)

transf = ops.geomTransf.Linear(vecxz=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
ops.element.elasticBeamColumn(pg="Beam", transf=transf, A=A, E=E, Iz=Iz)

ops.fix(pg="Pin",    dofs=(1, 1, 0))    # pin:    ux, uy held
ops.fix(pg="Roller", dofs=(0, 1, 0))    # roller: uy held only

ts = ops.timeSeries.Linear()

# --- 4. Capture, read back by name, and CHECK against T3 ---
spec = DomainCaptureSpec(opensees=ops)
spec.nodes(pg="Mid", components=["displacement"])
with ops.domain_capture(spec, path="ssbeam_run.h5") as cap:
    cap.begin_stage("midspan_load", kind="static")
    ops.analyze(steps=1)
    cap.step(t=1.0)
    cap.end_stage()

results = Results.from_native(
    "ssbeam_run.h5", model=OpenSeesModel.from_h5("ssbeam_run.h5"),
)
slab = results.nodes.get(pg="Mid", component="displacement_y")

delta_reload = abs(float(slab.values[-1, 0]))
delta_exact  = P * L**3 / (48.0 * E * Iz)
print(f"delta_reload = {delta_reload*1e3:.4f} mm")
print(f"delta_exact  = {delta_exact*1e3:.4f} mm")
print(f"error        = {abs(delta_reload-delta_exact)/delta_exact*100:.4f} %")
```

Run it. You should see:

```
built    snapshot_id = ac230fece5973edfadc9ab919a23daf5
reloaded snapshot_id = ac230fece5973edfadc9ab919a23daf5
hash match           = True
delta_reload = 2.0000 mm
delta_exact  = 2.0000 mm
error        = 0.0000 %
```

Two things just got proven. The two `snapshot_id` lines are **identical** —
the model you saved is byte-for-content the model you reloaded. And the
deflection is **2.00 mm**, exactly `PL³/48EI`, computed from a model that
spent a moment on disk. (As in T1, the elastic beam-column carries the
cubic bending shape exactly, so there's no discretization error — the only
thing being tested here is that persistence didn't change a single number.)

Now the why.

## Step 1 — A session can save itself

```python
with apeGmsh(model_name="ssbeam", save_to="ssbeam.h5", overwrite=True) as g:
    ...
    fem = g.mesh.queries.get_fem_data()
    snap_built = fem.snapshot_id
    # ssbeam.h5 is written HERE, as the `with` block exits.
```

The geometry is the only thing genuinely new versus T1: we drop a point at
midspan (`pm`) and build the beam from **two** curves, `sl` and `sr`, so
there's a real mesh node sitting exactly at the load point. Both curves go
into the one `"Beam"` physical group; the midspan point becomes `"Mid"`.
Standard T3 setup.

The persistence is in the constructor: `save_to="ssbeam.h5"`. This arms an
**autosave** — when the `with` block exits (or you call `g.end()`),
apeGmsh writes the meshed model to a native `.h5` file. `overwrite=True`
says it's fine to clobber an existing `ssbeam.h5`; with `overwrite=False`,
an existing target raises `FileExistsError` so you can't trample a file by
accident.

!!! warning "Autosave fires on exit, and only warns if it fails"
    Two things to internalise. **First**, `save_to=` does *not* write
    eagerly — nothing hits disk until `end()`/`__exit__`. If the process
    dies inside the `with` block, you get nothing. **Second**, the autosave
    on exit *catches and warns* on a write failure (so Gmsh can still
    finalize cleanly) rather than raising — a failed autosave can slip by
    as a warning. When persistence actually matters, call **`g.save()`**
    explicitly inside the block:

    ```python
    g.save()              # checkpoint now, to the save_to= target
    g.save("ckpt.h5")     # ...or to an explicit path
    ```

    `g.save()` with neither an explicit path nor a `save_to=` set raises
    `RuntimeError` — it won't guess where to put your model.

### What gets saved — and the snapshot you check against

Notice we grab `fem` with a **bare** `get_fem_data()` — no `dim=` filter.
That's deliberate. The autosave writes the *whole* meshed model: the 16
line elements of `"Beam"` **and** the three point "elements" that back the
`"Pin"`, `"Roller"`, and `"Mid"` physical groups. To compare apples to
apples after reload, the snapshot we remember (`snap_built`) has to be that
same full model — so we take the full snapshot here. (Filter to `dim=1` for
the solve if you like; the beam elements are the same either way. We just
keep one canonical snapshot so the hashes line up cleanly.)

`fem.snapshot_id` is a **32-character content hash** over everything in the
snapshot — nodes, elements, physical groups, labels, constraints, loads,
masses. Two snapshots with identical content produce the identical hash.
That's the property the next step leans on.

!!! note "`save_to`/`g.save()` write the *neutral* model only"
    The native `.h5` from `g.save()` holds the apeGmsh **neutral zone** —
    geometry, mesh, names — and no OpenSees deck. That's exactly what you
    want for "save the model, decide how to analyse it later." If you also
    want the *OpenSees* side (transforms, recorders) in the file, that's a
    different call — `apeSees(fem).h5(path)` writes a **two-zone** file
    (neutral **+** `/opensees/`). We don't need it here, but it's the same
    family of API.

## Step 2 — Reload, with an integrity check baked in

```python
fem2 = FEMData.from_h5("ssbeam.h5")
print(f"reloaded snapshot_id = {fem2.snapshot_id}")
print(f"hash match           = {fem2.snapshot_id == snap_built}")
```

`FEMData.from_h5(path)` rebuilds a full `FEMData` snapshot from the file —
nodes, elements, physical groups, labels, the lot. No live Gmsh session is
involved; the snapshot is self-sufficient, which is the entire reason it
round-trips.

The important part is invisible: **`from_h5` re-verifies the file's
`/meta/snapshot_id`.** On read it recomputes the content hash of the
rebuilt model and compares it against the hash stored when the file was
written. If a single coordinate had been tampered with, it would raise
`MalformedH5Error('snapshot_id mismatch')` rather than hand you a quietly
corrupted model. That's why our two printed hashes match: the file is
intact, and the reloaded model *is* the model we built.

!!! tip "`from_h5` is fail-loud by design"
    A missing `/meta` group raises `MalformedH5Error`; a file written by a
    too-new schema raises `SchemaVersionError`. apeGmsh would rather refuse
    to open a file than silently feed you a wrong model. You don't have to
    do anything to opt in — the check runs on every `from_h5`.

There's a second flavour of reload worth knowing about (we don't use it
here, but you'll meet it the day you assemble models):

```python
g2 = apeGmsh.from_h5("ssbeam.h5")   # a *chain-phase* session, no gmsh
```

Mind the difference: **`FEMData.from_h5` gives you a snapshot**;
**`apeGmsh.from_h5` gives you a session** — but a *chain-phase* one with no
live Gmsh kernel behind it. You can `g2.compose(...)` other saved models
onto it and `g2.save(...)` the result, but `g2.model.*` and
`g2.mesh.generation.*` will fail (there's no kernel to draw into). For
"reload one model and analyse it," `FEMData.from_h5` is the tool — that's
what we use.

## Step 3 — Solve from the reloaded snapshot

```python
ops = apeSees(fem2)            # <- the RELOADED snapshot, not the original
ops.model(ndm=2, ndf=3)
transf = ops.geomTransf.Linear(vecxz=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
ops.element.elasticBeamColumn(pg="Beam", transf=transf, A=A, E=E, Iz=Iz)
ops.fix(pg="Pin",    dofs=(1, 1, 0))
ops.fix(pg="Roller", dofs=(0, 1, 0))
```

This is pure T3 — and that's the lesson. `apeSees(fem2)` builds the typed
bridge from `fem2`, the snapshot that just came **off disk**, and every
physical-group name still works: `"Beam"`, `"Pin"`, `"Roller"`, `"Mid"`.
The names survived the round-trip, so the bridge resolves them exactly as
it would have on the live session.

The supports are the only physics difference from the T1 cantilever, and
they're textbook simply-supported: the `"Pin"` holds `ux` and `uy`
(`dofs=(1, 1, 0)`, rotation free), the `"Roller"` holds only `uy`
(`dofs=(0, 1, 0)`). The load, pattern, and analysis chain are the same
shape you saw in T1.

## Step 4 — Capture, read by name, and the viewer that won't crash

```python
spec = DomainCaptureSpec(opensees=ops)
spec.nodes(pg="Mid", components=["displacement"])
with ops.domain_capture(spec, path="ssbeam_run.h5") as cap:
    cap.begin_stage("midspan_load", kind="static")
    ops.analyze(steps=1)
    cap.step(t=1.0)
    cap.end_stage()

results = Results.from_native(
    "ssbeam_run.h5", model=OpenSeesModel.from_h5("ssbeam_run.h5"),
)
slab = results.nodes.get(pg="Mid", component="displacement_y")
```

Same one capture-and-read path as T1: declare a `DomainCaptureSpec` for the
`"Mid"` displacement, run one static step in-process, and the run file
`ssbeam_run.h5` ends up holding both the result *and* a copy of the model.

`Results.from_native(...)` opens it — and **the `model=` argument is
required.** This trips people up, so it's worth saying plainly: `Results`
stores numbers against raw node and element ids. To let you ask for
`"Mid"` instead of a tag, it needs a **model broker** to translate names
into ids. That broker is `OpenSeesModel`. Here the model rides inside the
same run file (the Composed-file pattern), so we point
`OpenSeesModel.from_h5` at the same path. Omit `model=` and you get a
`TypeError` — it's not optional, by design.

Then the payoff: `results.nodes.get(pg="Mid", component="displacement_y")`
hands back the vertical displacement at the `"Mid"` group — *the same name
we loaded* — and `slab.values[-1, 0]` is the last step at the one midspan
node. Magnitude, print, compare to `PL³/48EI`. 2.00 mm, dead on, from a
model that has been to disk and back.

### See it — the notebook-safe way

```python
results.show_web()
```

`results.show_web()` launches the **notebook-safe** web viewer — an
interactive 3-D view of the deformed beam, rendered right in your Jupyter
output cell. In a notebook, this is the one to reach for.

!!! warning "Don't call `results.viewer()` in a notebook"
    The desktop viewer (`results.viewer()`, default `blocking=True`) runs a
    native VTK + Qt event loop that **crashes a Jupyter or VS Code kernel**
    — the same hazard T1 warns about. In a notebook, always use
    `results.show_web()` instead. (At a real terminal, the desktop viewer
    is fine; `results.viewer(blocking=False)` even spawns it as a
    non-blocking subprocess.)

## What you just learned

You did a full **build → save → reload → solve → view** loop, and the
reloaded model reproduced the answer *exactly*:

- **`save_to=` arms an autosave** that writes a native `.h5` when the
  session's `with` block exits. It writes the **neutral** model (geometry,
  mesh, names) — no OpenSees needed. For a guaranteed checkpoint mid-session,
  call **`g.save()`** explicitly; the autosave only *warns* on failure.
- **`FEMData.from_h5` reloads with an integrity check.** It re-verifies the
  stored `snapshot_id` against the rebuilt model and raises
  `MalformedH5Error` on any corruption — so a clean reload is a *proven*
  clean reload. Don't confuse it with **`apeGmsh.from_h5`**, which returns
  a kernel-less *chain-phase session* for composing saved models.
- **Names survive the round-trip.** `"Beam"`, `"Pin"`, `"Mid"` all resolve
  on the reloaded snapshot exactly as on the live one — which is why
  `apeSees(fem2)` is identical to building from the original.
- **`Results` needs `model=`.** The model broker is what turns stored ids
  back into your physical-group names; it's a required argument, not a
  convenience.
- **`show_web()` for the picture in a notebook** — and never the blocking
  `results.viewer()`, which crashes the kernel.

And the round-trip *checks out*: the same `snapshot_id`, and 2.00 mm —
exactly `PL³/48EI` — after the model has been saved and reopened.

## Where next

- **[T3 · A simply-supported beam, the apeGmsh way](#)** — if you skipped
  it, this is where the loads/masses/sections *composites* are taught; T4
  reused its beam without re-deriving the mechanics.
- **[Results & export recipes](../how-to/index.md)** — the alternatives we
  deliberately didn't fork into here: exporting a runnable Tcl/Py deck,
  classic recorders, and STKO `.mpco` files.
- **[Composing saved models](../how-to/index.md)** — where `apeGmsh.from_h5`
  earns its keep: reload several saved `.h5` models and `g.compose(...)`
  them into one assembly.
- **[Core mental model](../concepts/mental-model.md)** — the ideas behind
  the snapshot, the broker, and the name-everything habit, on one page.
