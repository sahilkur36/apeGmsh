# Your first model in 10 minutes

You're going to build, solve, and inspect a real finite-element model end to
end: a steel cantilever beam, fixed at one end, with a point load at the tip.
By the end you'll have a deflection number you can trust — because you'll check
it against a formula you already know by heart.

We pick a cantilever on purpose. It is the *Hello, World* of structural
mechanics: one element type, one support, one load, and a closed-form answer
that's been in every textbook for a century. If apeGmsh gets this right, you
can believe what it tells you about the models that don't have closed-form
answers.

## The problem

```
        P = 10 kN  (downward)
                              |
                              v
  Fixed ████|=============================●  ← tip
        ████|                                   (free end)
        ████|<------------ L = 3 m ------------>|

  Section: 0.10 m × 0.20 m rectangle (strong axis bending)
  Material: steel, E = 200 GPa
```

A tip-loaded cantilever has a deflection you can write down without solving
anything:

$$
\delta_{\text{tip}} \;=\; \frac{P\,L^{3}}{3\,E\,I}
$$

With $P = 10{,}000\ \text{N}$, $L = 3\ \text{m}$, $E = 200\times10^{9}\ \text{Pa}$,
and $I = \tfrac{b h^{3}}{12} = \tfrac{0.10 \cdot 0.20^{3}}{12} = 6.667\times10^{-5}\ \text{m}^4$:

$$
\delta_{\text{tip}} \;=\; \frac{10{,}000 \cdot 3^{3}}{3 \cdot 200\times10^{9} \cdot 6.667\times10^{-5}}
\;=\; 6.75\times10^{-3}\ \text{m} \;=\; 6.75\ \text{mm}
$$

Keep **6.75 mm** in your back pocket. That's the number apeGmsh has to
reproduce.

!!! note "Units"
    apeGmsh is unit-agnostic — it stores the numbers you give it. We work in
    **consistent SI** throughout: metres, newtons, pascals. Pick a consistent
    system and stick to it; the deflection comes out in metres because the
    geometry is in metres.

## Install

```bash
pip install apeGmsh[all]
```

The `[all]` extra pulls in everything you need for this tutorial, including the
web viewer. You also need **OpenSees** — apeGmsh drives it through
[openseespy](https://pypi.org/project/openseespy/), which `[all]` installs for
you. If you only want the modelling core, `pip install apeGmsh` is enough, but
this tutorial runs a real solve, so install `[all]`.

## The whole model

Here is the entire script. We'll walk through it block by block right after —
but it's short enough to read top to bottom first, so do that. Under 40 lines
of real work takes you from an empty session to a verified deflection.

```python
from apeGmsh import apeGmsh, Results
from apeGmsh.opensees import apeSees, OpenSeesModel
from apeGmsh.results.capture.spec import DomainCaptureSpec

# --- Problem data (consistent SI: m, N, Pa) ---
L  = 3.0          # length        [m]
E  = 200e9        # Young's mod.   [Pa]  (steel)
b, h = 0.10, 0.20 # section sides  [m]
A  = b * h                  # area            [m^2]
Iz = b * h**3 / 12.0        # strong-axis I   [m^4]
P  = 10_000.0     # tip load       [N]  (downward, -y)

# --- 1. Geometry + physical groups, inside a session ---
with apeGmsh(model_name="cantilever") as g:
    p0   = g.model.geometry.add_point(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    p1   = g.model.geometry.add_point(L,   0.0, 0.0)
    beam = g.model.geometry.add_line(p0, p1)
    g.model.sync()

    g.physical.add(1, [beam], name="Beam")    # the line  -> elements
    g.physical.add(0, [p0],   name="Fixed")   # left end  -> support
    g.physical.add(0, [p1],   name="Tip")     # right end -> load + readout

    g.mesh.sizing.set_global_size(L / 10.0)   # ~10 line elements
    g.mesh.generation.generate(1)
    fem = g.mesh.queries.get_fem_data(dim=1)

# --- 2. Build the OpenSees model through the typed bridge ---
ops = apeSees(fem)
ops.model(ndm=2, ndf=3)                       # 2-D frame: ux, uy, thetaz

transf = ops.geomTransf.Linear(vecxz=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
ops.element.elasticBeamColumn(pg="Beam", transf=transf, A=A, E=E, Iz=Iz)

ops.fix(pg="Fixed", dofs=(1, 1, 1))           # clamp ux, uy, thetaz

ts = ops.timeSeries.Linear()
with ops.pattern.Plain(series=ts) as pat:
    pat.load(pg="Tip", forces=(0.0, -P, 0.0)) # downward point load

ops.constraints.Plain()
ops.numberer.Plain()
ops.system.BandGeneral()
ops.test.NormDispIncr(tol=1e-10, max_iter=10)
ops.algorithm.Linear()
ops.integrator.LoadControl(dlam=1.0)
ops.analysis.Static()

# --- 3. Solve, capturing the tip displacement ---
spec = DomainCaptureSpec(opensees=ops)
spec.nodes(pg="Tip", components=["displacement"])
with ops.domain_capture(spec, path="run.h5") as cap:
    cap.begin_stage("tip_load", kind="static")
    ops.analyze(steps=1)
    cap.step(t=1.0)
    cap.end_stage()

# --- 4. Read the result back by physical-group NAME ---
results = Results.from_native("run.h5", model=OpenSeesModel.from_h5("run.h5"))
slab = results.nodes.get(pg="Tip", component="displacement_y")

delta_fem = abs(float(slab.values[-1, 0]))
delta_exact = P * L**3 / (3.0 * E * Iz)
print(f"delta_FEM   = {delta_fem*1e3:.3f} mm")
print(f"delta_exact = {delta_exact*1e3:.3f} mm")
print(f"error       = {abs(delta_fem-delta_exact)/delta_exact*100:.4f} %")
```

Run it. You should see:

```
delta_FEM   = 6.750 mm
delta_exact = 6.750 mm
error       = 0.0000 %
```

That's our 6.75 mm, dead on. (The error is exactly zero, not just small: the
elastic beam-column element carries the cubic bending shape exactly, so for a
tip point load it *is* the closed-form solution — no discretization error to
speak of.) Now let's see why each block does what it does.

## Step 1 — A session owns the geometry

```python
with apeGmsh(model_name="cantilever") as g:
    p0   = g.model.geometry.add_point(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    p1   = g.model.geometry.add_point(L,   0.0, 0.0)
    beam = g.model.geometry.add_line(p0, p1)
    g.model.sync()
```

`apeGmsh(...)` opens a **session** — the live Gmsh kernel that owns your
geometry and mesh. Everything you do to the model goes through composites
hanging off `g` (here `g.model.geometry`). Using it as a context manager
(`with ... as g:`) means the kernel is cleaned up for you when the block exits.

We place two points and a line between them — that's the whole geometry. The
`g.model.sync()` flushes those operations into the kernel so the next steps can
see them.

### Physical groups: name the parts you care about

```python
    g.physical.add(1, [beam], name="Beam")    # dim 1 = the curve
    g.physical.add(0, [p0],   name="Fixed")   # dim 0 = a point
    g.physical.add(0, [p1],   name="Tip")
```

This is the single most important habit in apeGmsh. A **physical group** is a
*named* tag you attach to geometry — `"Beam"`, `"Fixed"`, `"Tip"`. From here on
you address everything by these names, never by raw entity numbers. Supports go
on `"Fixed"`, the load goes on `"Tip"`, and when you read results back you ask
for `"Tip"` again. The names survive meshing, solving, and post-processing —
they are your handle on the model through every stage.

The first argument is the **dimension**: `1` for the line (which will become
beam elements), `0` for the end points (which will become single nodes for the
support and the load).

### Mesh it

```python
    g.mesh.sizing.set_global_size(L / 10.0)   # target element length
    g.mesh.generation.generate(1)             # 1 = mesh 1-D entities
    fem = g.mesh.queries.get_fem_data(dim=1)
```

We ask for a target element length of `L/10`, then `generate(1)` meshes the
1-D geometry into about ten line elements. (For a linear-elastic beam under a
tip point load you'd get the exact answer with a *single* element — but ten
keeps the picture honest and gives the viewer something to draw.)

The payoff line is `get_fem_data(dim=1)`. This takes a **snapshot** of the
meshed model — nodes, elements, and your physical groups, frozen into a
`FEMData` object called `fem`. That snapshot is the bridge between the geometry
world (inside the `with`) and the OpenSees world (outside it). Notice we grab
it *before* the block closes, then carry it forward.

## Step 2 — The typed OpenSees bridge

```python
ops = apeSees(fem)
ops.model(ndm=2, ndf=3)
```

`apeSees(fem)` constructs the **OpenSees bridge** from your snapshot. This is
how apeGmsh drives OpenSees: not by writing raw `ops.element('...', ...)`
strings, but through **typed primitives** with real signatures your editor can
autocomplete and your type checker can verify. You declare *what* you want; the
bridge resolves your physical-group names against `fem` and emits a correct
deck.

`ops.model(ndm=2, ndf=3)` must come first. We use a **2-D frame**: 2 spatial
dimensions, 3 degrees of freedom per node — horizontal, vertical, and an
in-plane rotation ($u_x, u_y, \theta_z$). That rotation DOF is what makes this
a *beam* and not a truss.

```python
transf = ops.geomTransf.Linear(vecxz=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
ops.element.elasticBeamColumn(pg="Beam", transf=transf, A=A, E=E, Iz=Iz)
```

Every beam-column element needs a **geometric transformation** — the rule that
maps the element's local axes to global ones. `Linear` is the small-deflection
choice (exactly right for this elastic problem); the `vecxz` vector orients the
local axes. The transform comes back as a *handle* — you pass the object
itself, not a string name — and apeGmsh wires up the tags for you.

Then `ops.element.elasticBeamColumn(pg="Beam", ...)` writes **every element in
the `"Beam"` physical group** as a linear-elastic beam-column with the area,
modulus, and second moment we computed up top. One line, the whole member —
because you targeted the group by name.

```python
ops.fix(pg="Fixed", dofs=(1, 1, 1))
```

The clamp. `dofs=(1, 1, 1)` fixes all three DOFs (1 = fixed, 0 = free) at every
node in `"Fixed"` — here that's the single left-end node. A fully-fixed end is
exactly the cantilever boundary condition.

```python
ts = ops.timeSeries.Linear()
with ops.pattern.Plain(series=ts) as pat:
    pat.load(pg="Tip", forces=(0.0, -P, 0.0))
```

Loads live inside a **pattern**. A `Plain` pattern scaled by a `Linear` time
series ramps the load from zero to full over the analysis. `pat.load(pg="Tip",
...)` puts a force on every node in `"Tip"` — `(0.0, -P, 0.0)` is `P` newtons
straight down (negative $y$), with no moment.

The remaining lines (`constraints`, `numberer`, `system`, `test`, `algorithm`,
`integrator`, `analysis`) are the standard OpenSees **analysis chain** — the
solver recipe. For a single linear step this is boilerplate; later tutorials
explain when you'd reach for something other than `Linear`/`Static`.

!!! tip "What the bridge does and doesn't carry over"
    The bridge auto-emits multi-point constraints you declared on the session.
    Loads, masses, and fixities are *re-declared here on `ops`* (as we did with
    `ops.fix` and `pat.load`) — that's by design, so the runnable deck is
    explicit about its boundary conditions.

## Step 3 — Solve and capture

```python
spec = DomainCaptureSpec(opensees=ops)
spec.nodes(pg="Tip", components=["displacement"])
with ops.domain_capture(spec, path="run.h5") as cap:
    cap.begin_stage("tip_load", kind="static")
    ops.analyze(steps=1)
    cap.step(t=1.0)
    cap.end_stage()
```

We want the tip displacement, so we declare a **capture spec**: record the
`displacement` of every node in `"Tip"`. Again — by name.

`ops.domain_capture(...)` opens an in-process recorder writing to `run.h5`.
Inside the `with`, we open a stage, run `ops.analyze(steps=1)` (one static
load step — the solve happens here, in-process, through openseespy), snapshot
the state with `cap.step(t=1.0)`, and close the stage. When the block exits,
`run.h5` holds both the result *and* a copy of the model, in one file.

!!! note "This is one path of several — on purpose"
    We did two things here that have alternatives, and this tutorial picks one
    of each so you reach a result without a detour:

    - **How you run** — we solved *in-process* with `ops.analyze`. You can
      instead **export a runnable deck** with `ops.tcl("model.tcl")` or
      `ops.py("model.py")` and run it elsewhere (great for sharing or
      version-controlling the OpenSees model).
    - **How you record** — we used *domain capture* (→ `Results.from_native`).
      You can also use classic recorders (→ `Results.from_recorders`) or an
      **MPCO** recorder for STKO (→ `Results.from_mpco`).

    The read-side API is identical whichever you choose. When you're ready to
    pick, see the [results & export recipes](../how-to/index.md) — you don't
    need them to finish here.

## Step 4 — Read it back, by name

```python
results = Results.from_native("run.h5", model=OpenSeesModel.from_h5("run.h5"))
slab = results.nodes.get(pg="Tip", component="displacement_y")
delta_fem = abs(float(slab.values[-1, 0]))
```

`Results.from_native(...)` opens the run file. **The `model=` argument is
required** — `Results` needs a model broker to translate physical-group names
back into nodes and elements. Here the model lives in the same file (the
Composed-file pattern), so we point `OpenSeesModel.from_h5` at the same path.

Then the moment of truth: `results.nodes.get(pg="Tip", component="displacement_y")`.
You ask for the vertical displacement of the `"Tip"` group — *the same name you
used to apply the load* — and get back a typed slab of values. `slab.values[-1, 0]`
is the last step, first (and only) tip node. We take the magnitude, print it
next to `PL³/3EI`, and watch them match.

This is the payoff of naming everything: you never once touched a raw node
number. The model, the load, and the readout all speak the same language —
your physical-group names.

## See it

```python
results.show_web()
```

`results.show_web()` launches the **notebook-safe** web viewer — an interactive
3-D view of the deformed shape, right in your Jupyter output cell. Use this one
in notebooks.

!!! warning "Don't call `results.viewer()` in a notebook"
    The desktop viewer (`results.viewer()`, default `blocking=True`) runs a
    native VTK + Qt event loop that **crashes a Jupyter or VS Code kernel**.
    In a notebook, always reach for `results.show_web()` instead.

## What you just learned

In one short script you ran the entire apeGmsh spine:

- **Session → geometry → physical groups.** Open a session, draw the geometry,
  and *name* the parts you care about with `g.physical.add(...)`. Those names
  are your handle on the model forever after.
- **`get_fem_data` is the snapshot.** It freezes the meshed model into a
  `FEMData` object that carries your names across the boundary into OpenSees.
- **The typed bridge.** `apeSees(fem)` drives OpenSees through typed
  primitives — `ops.geomTransf.Linear`, `ops.element.elasticBeamColumn`,
  `ops.fix(pg=...)`, `ops.pattern.Plain` — never raw command strings.
- **Capture → `Results` → read by name.** `ops.domain_capture` records the
  solve; `Results.from_native(..., model=...)` reads it back; `results.nodes.get(pg=...)`
  pulls displacements out by physical-group name.
- **`show_web()` for the picture**, and it's the kernel-safe choice in
  notebooks.

And the model *checks out* — 6.75 mm, exactly `PL³/3EI`.

## Where next

- **[A plate in tension](#)** — the same typed bridge on a 2-D *solid*:
  `nDMaterial`, a face load, and a stress field you read back by physical
  group.
- **[The SS beam, the apeGmsh way](#)** — meet the loads/masses/sections
  *composites*: declare a distributed load once and let apeGmsh resolve the
  tributary work for you.
- **[Save, reload, view](#)** — persist a model to disk and reopen it, and the
  full notebook-safe results loop.
- **[Core mental model](../concepts/mental-model.md)** — the six ideas behind
  everything you just did, on one page.
