# Plane-wave SSI — an absorbing soil column

Every soil-structure-interaction model has the same problem: the soil
extends to infinity, but your mesh can't. Chop it off with a fixed
boundary and outgoing waves bounce straight back in, contaminating the
response with reflections that aren't real. The fix is an **absorbing
boundary** — a truncation that lets waves leave and never return, so a
finite box behaves like the half-space it's cut from.

This example builds the smallest model that exercises the whole
machinery: a one-dimensional soil column shaken from below by a single
shear pulse. It's the `apeGmsh` capstone for ADR 0054 — the three pieces
that ship the `ASDAbsorbingBoundary3D` element, used together:

1. **`g.parts.add_plane_wave_box`** builds the soil box *and* wraps it in
   a one-element-thick absorbing **skin** on its five truncation faces,
   tagging each skin cell with its boundary type (`btype`).
2. **`ops.element.absorbing_boundary`** fans the skin out into one
   `ASDAbsorbingBoundary3D` per cell and attaches the **base input** —
   the incident wave is injected as a velocity on the bottom faces.
3. **`s.activate_absorbing`** flips the boundary from its gravity-stage
   *hold* into *absorbing* mode for the transient.

The known answer is physics, in two parts. The pulse should reach the
free surface one **shear-wave traveltime** $H/V_s$ after it leaves the
base, and once it has passed through, the column should go **quiet** —
the energy radiates out the bottom instead of reverberating.

## The problem

```
         free surface (z = 0)            ← we record v_x here
        ┌───────────────────────┐  ─┐

        base shear-velocity pulse:
          Ricker, f_n = 4 Hz, in +x
```

The soil's shear-wave speed follows from its stiffness and density,
$V_s=\sqrt{G/\rho}$. We pick the numbers backwards from a clean
$V_s=200\ \text{m/s}$:

$$
G = \rho V_s^2 = 8.0\times10^{7}\ \text{Pa},\qquad
E = 2G(1+\nu) = 2.08\times10^{8}\ \text{Pa}.
$$

The column is $H=40\ \text{m}$ deep, so a wave leaving the base reaches
the surface after

$$
\frac{H}{V_s} = \frac{40}{200} = 0.20\ \text{s}.
$$

That's the first thing we'll check. The second is radiation: after the
pulse has come and gone, the surface velocity should collapse to a tiny
fraction of its peak, because a quiet base doesn't reflect it back.

!!! note "Units"
    Consistent SI throughout — metres, newtons, pascals, kilograms,
    seconds. Velocities come out in m/s.

## The whole model

The whole script, top to bottom. It's a `apeGmsh` build, the typed
bridge, and a **two-verb staged analysis** — flip, then run.

```python

from apeGmsh.opensees.time_series.time_series import Ricker

# --- Problem data (consistent SI: m, N, Pa, kg, s) ---

traveltime = H / Vs                  # 0.20 s

# --- Base shear-velocity pulse (Ricker wavelet, +x) ---
f_n, t_center, dt, t_total = 4.0, 0.15, 0.002, 1.0
n_steps = round(t_total / dt)

surf = "surf_vel.out"

# --- 1. Geometry: soil box + absorbing skin in one call ---
with apeGmsh(model_name="pwbox_ssi") as g:
    res = g.parts.add_plane_wave_box(
        x=(20.0, 2),                 # lateral (size, n) — coarse: the wave is vertical
        y=(20.0, 2),
        z=(H, 16),                   # depth 40 m in 2.5 m elements
    )
    g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=3)
    fem = g.mesh.queries.get_fem_data()

# --- 2. Bridge: soil brick + the absorbing skin ---
ops = apeSees(fem)
ops.model(ndm=3, ndf=3)

soil = ops.register(ElasticIsotropic(E=E, nu=nu, rho=rho))
base = ops.register(Ricker(f_n=f_n, t_total=t_total, dt=dt,
                           t_center=t_center, kind="velocity", factor=0.01))

ops.element.stdBrick(pg=res.soil_pg, material=soil)          # the soil
ops.element.absorbing_boundary(                              # the skin

    base_series=base, base_dirs=("x",),                     # inject v_x at the base
)

# --- 3. Staged dynamic analysis: flip the boundary, then run ---
with ops.stage(name="dynamic") as s:
    s.activate_absorbing(pg=res.skin_all_pg)                 # hold -> absorbing
    s.recorder(ops.recorder.Node(
        file=surf, response="vel",
        pg=res.free_surface_pg, dofs=(1,), time_format="dt",
    ))
    s.analysis(
        test=ops.test.NormDispIncr(tol=1e-8, max_iter=20),

        constraints=ops.constraints.Transformation(),
        numberer=ops.numberer.RCM(),
        system=ops.system.UmfPack(),
        analysis=ops.analysis.Transient(),
    )
    s.run(n_increments=n_steps, dt=dt)

ops.py("ssi.py", run=True)              # emit the openseespy deck and run it

# --- 4. Read the surface velocity, run the two checks ---
data = np.loadtxt(surf)
t = data[:, 0]
v = data[:, 1:].mean(axis=1)            # x-velocity, averaged over the surface
absv = np.abs(v)

peak = absv.max()
t_arr = t[int(np.argmax(absv > 0.05 * peak))]      # first 5%-of-peak crossing
late = float(absv[t >= 0.7].max())                 # after the pulse has passed

print(f"H/Vs            = {traveltime:.3f} s")
print(f"first arrival   = {t_arr:.3f} s")
print(f"peak |v|        = {peak:.3e} m/s")
print(f"late max (>0.7) = {late:.3e} m/s   ({late/peak:.2%} of peak)")
```

Run it. You should see (after the mesh and OpenSees banners):

```
H/Vs            = 0.200 s
first arrival   = 0.198 s
peak |v|        = 6.949e-04 m/s
late max (>0.7) = 6.488e-06 m/s   (0.93% of peak)
```

![Free-surface x-velocity for the absorbing soil column: flat until ~0.2 s, a single large down-up swing peaking near 0.41 s, then decaying to a flat quiet line well under 1% of peak after 0.7 s.](../assets/tut/plane-wave-ssi-surface.png)

Both checks land. The wave arrives at **0.198 s**, matching $H/V_s=0.20$
to 1 %. And after the pulse passes, the surface settles to **under 1 %**
of its peak — the energy left through the base. Hold a fixed base under
the same column and you'd see the opposite: the pulse reflects, comes
back up, and the surface rings on for cycle after cycle.

## Step 1 — One call builds the soil *and* its absorbing skin

```python
res = g.parts.add_plane_wave_box(x=(20.0, 2), y=(20.0, 2), z=(H, 16))
```

This is the turnkey entry point. Each axis is `(size, n_elements)`, and
the box is centred with its top face at $z=0$ (the free surface). What
makes it more than `add_box` is the **skin**: a one-element-thick shell
wrapped around the five truncation faces — the four sides and the bottom,
never the free-surface top.

That skin isn't decorative. The absorbing element is a *surrogate* for
the half-space outside the box, with zero gravity mass in its hold
state — so it has to be genuinely *extra* material outside an intact
soil box, not a reinterpreted outer ring (reinterpreting would corrupt
the in-situ stress; see ADR 0054). The builder lays it down as extra
structured grid cells, so the soil box stays whole and the skin shares
its nodes by construction.

The `res` it returns is an `AbsorbingSkinResult` — a bag of physical-
group names so you never touch a raw tag:

| field | what it names |
|---|---|
| `res.soil_pg` | the intact interior soil |
| `res.skin_pgs` | `btype -> PG` for every skin cell type (`"L"`, `"LF"`, `"BLF"`, …) |
| `res.skin_all_pg` | roll-up over the whole skin (the flip / Rayleigh target) |
| `res.bottom_pgs` | the `B`-containing PGs — where base input goes |
| `res.free_surface_pg` | the soil top face (`z=0`) — where we record |

Each skin cell's `btype` is the set of faces it lies outside of, OR-
combined: `L`/`R` for the $\pm x$ faces, `F`/`K` for $\pm y$, `B` for the
bottom. A side panel is one letter (`L`), a vertical edge two (`LF`), a
bottom corner three (`BLF`). For this `2×2×16` box that's 64 soil bricks
wrapped by 208 skin cells.

## Step 2 — Fan the skin into elements, attach the input

```python
soil = ops.register(ElasticIsotropic(E=E, nu=nu, rho=rho))
base = ops.register(Ricker(f_n=f_n, t_total=t_total, dt=dt,
                           t_center=t_center, kind="velocity", factor=0.01))

ops.element.stdBrick(pg=res.soil_pg, material=soil)
ops.element.absorbing_boundary(
    skin=res, material=soil, base_series=base, base_dirs=("x",),
)
```

The soil is an ordinary `stdBrick` over `res.soil_pg`. The skin is one
call: `absorbing_boundary` walks `res.skin_pgs` and emits **one
`ASDAbsorbingBoundary3D` per cell** with that cell's fixed `btype`.

Two subtleties worth knowing:

- **The skin reads the soil material, it doesn't *depend* on it.** The
  element wants raw $G$, $\nu$, $\rho$ doubles, not a material tag — so
  `material=soil` is consumed to derive $G=E/2(1+\nu)$ at the call site,
  and only the soil's own `nDMaterial` is emitted (you'll find exactly
  one in the deck). The skin carries floats.
- **The base input rides the bottom only.** `base_series` is attached as
  a velocity (`-fx`, since `base_dirs=("x",)`) to the `B`-containing
  cells and nowhere else — that's the incident wave entering from below.
  Because it's a velocity input, the wavelet is `kind="velocity"`.

A `Ricker` wavelet is the standard single-pulse source: a clean,
band-limited bump centred at `t_center`. It expands to a tabulated
`timeSeries Path` at emit time — nothing exotic reaches OpenSees.

## Step 3 — Flip, then run

```python
with ops.stage(name="dynamic") as s:
    s.activate_absorbing(pg=res.skin_all_pg)
    ...
    s.run(n_increments=n_steps, dt=dt)
```

The absorbing element has two lives. In its **hold** state (stage 0) it
acts like a fixed support — that's what holds the box still while gravity
settles in (not exercised here, but it's why the skin is *extra*
material). In its **absorbing** state (stage 1) the dashpots switch on
and it radiates. `s.activate_absorbing(pg=res.skin_all_pg)` emits the
one-way switch — the OpenSees `parameter` / `addToParameter … stage` /
`updateParameter` sequence — once, *before* the transient `analyze`
loop, over every skin element.

Everything else is a standard implicit transient: `Newmark`,
`Transformation` constraints (the absorbing boundary imposes multi-point
constraints, so `Plain` won't do), and a `recorder Node` capturing the
free-surface $v_x$ with `time_format="dt"` so the output carries a time
column.

!!! note "Staged decks emit text, then run"
    A staged model can't be driven live in-process — `ops.analyze()`
    refuses it. Instead `ops.py("ssi.py", run=True)` writes the complete
    openseespy deck (both the flip and the `analyze` loop are baked in)
    and runs it in a subprocess. `ops.tcl(..., run=True)` does the same
    for Tcl.

## What the two numbers mean

**Arrival ≈ $H/V_s$.** The leading edge of the surface motion shows up at
0.198 s, one shear-wave traveltime after the pulse departs the base. The
*peak* comes a little later (~0.41 s) because the free surface doubles
the incident wave and the wavelet has finite width — but first motion is
governed cleanly by the wave speed you put in.

**Late/peak < 1 %.** This is the whole point of the boundary. The pulse
reaches the surface, reflects off it (a free surface *does* reflect),
travels back down — and is **absorbed** at the base instead of bouncing
back up. So there's no second arrival, and the surface goes quiet. The
green band in the figure ($t>0.7\ \text{s}$) holds at 0.93 % of peak. A
fixed base would trap the energy and the column would ring indefinitely.

## Where to go from here

This is the pure-wave skeleton. Two natural extensions, both already
supported:

- **In-situ stress first.** Real SSI runs a gravity stage *before* the
  transient, with the boundary holding the box, then establishes the
  geostatic state with `s.initial_stress(...)` before the flip. The skin
  is built to survive that hold — that's why it's extra material.
- **A structure on top.** The `waveletExample` this is modelled on is a
  bare soil column, but `res.free_surface_pg` is exactly where you'd
  embed or tie a foundation and let the radiated motion drive it.
- **A layered site.** Pass a top → bottom list of layers
  (`z=[(15, 3), (25, 5)]`) and the soil *and* the lateral skin split per
  layer. Emit one `stdBrick` per `res.soil_pgs[k]` with that layer's
  material, and give the skin the matching impedances with
  `ops.element.absorbing_boundary(skin=res, materials=[m0, m1, …])` — one
  per layer, top → bottom. The lateral boundary then carries the correct
  `Vs` at every depth instead of a single uniform value.
