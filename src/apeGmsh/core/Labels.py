Labels — geometry-time entity naming via internal physical groups.
==================================================================

Accessed via ``g.labels``.  Labels are human-readable names for
geometry entities that survive slicing, boolean operations, and
the STEP round-trip.  They are backed by Gmsh physical groups
whose names carry an internal ``_label:`` prefix so they are
invisible to solver-facing code (``g.physical``, ``fem.physical``,
the OpenSees exporter).

Two-tier naming
---------------
* **Labels** (``g.labels``) — geometry-time bookkeeping.
  Created automatically when ``label=`` is passed to any
  ``g.model.geometry.add_*`` method.  Used for addressing
  entities by name during boolean ops, slicing, and Part
  composition.  NOT visible to the solver.

* **Physical groups** (``g.physical``) — solver-time naming.
  Created explicitly by the user for boundary conditions,
  materials, and loads.  Visible to ``fem.physical`` and the
  OpenSees exporter.

The user promotes a label to a physical group when they are
ready to expose it to the solver::

    # Build and slice
    g.model.geometry.add_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, label="shaft")
    g.model.geometry.slice("shaft", axis='z', offset=1.5)

    # Promote to a solver-facing PG
    tags = g.labels.entities("shaft")
    g.physical.add_volume(tags, name="column_shaft")

Boolean safety
--------------
Both label PGs and user PGs survive every OCC boolean operation
(``fragment``, ``fuse``, ``cut``, ``intersect``).  Two module-level
functions — :func:`snapshot_physical_groups` and
:func:`remap_physical_groups` — implement a snapshot-then-remap
pattern that every boolean call site wraps around the OCC call.
Users never need to re-resolve labels after a boolean.

Naming convention
-----------------
At the Gmsh level, a label named ``"shaft"`` is stored as a
physical group with name ``"_label:shaft"``.  The prefix is
stripped by every method on this composite so the user never
sees it.  ``g.physical`` filters OUT any PG whose name starts
with ``_label:`` so the two tiers do not interfere.

# Geometric signature matching

#
# OCC's ``outDimTagsMap`` maps inputs to outputs at the input dim
# (volumes -> volumes for a 3D cut).  Sub-entity lineage — which
# pre-op face/edge/vertex became which post-op one — is **not**
# exposed by the gmsh Python API, so the snapshot/remap pattern alone
# cannot track sub-entities through a boolean.  The two failure modes
# from this gap were "Cannot remap (sub-topology renumbering)" and
# "is now empty" warnings for line/surface PGs after a cut.
#
# ─── Escape hatch if this approach hits its limits ──────────────────
# Gmsh's ``OCC_Internals::booleanOperator`` (gmsh source,
# ``src/geo/GModelIO_OCC.cpp``) already calls OCC's
# ``BRepAlgoAPI::Modified()/Generated()/IsDeleted()`` on every input
# shape — it just iterates top-level inputs only (no
# ``TopExp_Explorer`` descent into sub-shapes), and the builder is
# stack-local so we can't query it post-hoc.  Two paths to recover
# the real OCC sub-shape lineage if/when the geometric heuristic
# becomes the bottleneck:
#
# 1. **Upstream patch (preferred).**  ~120 LOC adding a TopExp
#    descent in each boolean ``case`` and a sidecar
#    ``OCC_Internals::_lastBooleanLineage`` exposed via
#    ``gmsh.model.occ.getLastBooleanLineage()``.  The data is
#    already computed; only the binding is missing.  File the issue
#    on gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh with the patch sketch.
#
# 2. **pythonocc-core sidecar (fallback if upstream rejects).**
#    Run the boolean through ``pythonocc-core`` in parallel,
#    harvest ``Modified()/Generated()/IsDeleted()`` per sub-shape,
#    map back to gmsh tags via the same geometric signatures.
#    Closes the cut-interface gap (``Generated()`` returns those
#    explicitly).  Caveat: gmsh internally runs ``SimplifyResult()``
#    after every boolean (collinear-edge consolidation, coplanar-
#    face merge) which pythonocc won't see — the two BReps can
#    diverge on cleanup ops.  Mitigation: replace gmsh's boolean
#    call with pythonocc's entirely and re-import the result, OR
#    accept the divergence on the small fraction of ops where
#    simplification fires.
#
# Effort estimates: option 1 is ~8-16h if upstream accepts;
# option 2 is ~2-3 days including the dependency story.  Don't
# implement either pre-emptively — the geometric heuristic below
# handles the common case (splits, merges, simple cuts) cleanly.
#
# These helpers add a geometric fallback: capture a tag-agnostic
# signature (bbox + centroid + dim-specific orientation) for every
# PG entity pre-op, and after the boolean match each pre-op signature
# against current entities at the same dim by bidirectional
# centroid-in-bbox containment plus a direction/normal-parallel
# check.  Handles splits, simple cuts, fragments, and merges
# generically.  See the module docstring for the failure modes that
# remain (new entities introduced by the cut interface, fully-
# consumed entities, coincident-then-ambiguous geometry).

# Angular tolerance for direction/normal parallelism — cos of ~5°.

        (the material merged, so the PG should follow).  Use this
        for ``fuse`` and ``intersect``.  When False (the default,
        appropriate for ``cut``), empty mappings mean the entity was

    skip_pg_names : set[str], optional
        PG names whose snapshot entries should be silently dropped
        on this pass — the old PG is removed, no recreate, no

    #    at the same dim.  Skip the expensive ``getCenterOfMass`` /
