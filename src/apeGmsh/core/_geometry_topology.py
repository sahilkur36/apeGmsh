"""Topology-driven sweep that removes orphan dim<=2 geometry left
behind by OCC boolean / fragment / cut operations.

Shared by :meth:`_Geometry.slice`, :meth:`_Geometry.cut_by_surface`,
and :meth:`_Boolean.fragment` so all three cleanup paths agree on
what "orphan" means.  Before this module, each call site carried
its own definition (slice used a per-call snapshot, fragment used a
centroid-in-bbox heuristic, the other bool ops did nothing) — the
audit found that each definition missed at least one failure mode.

The single rule encoded here: a dim<=2 entity stays IFF it bounds a
registered dim=3 volume at some depth OR is user-intentional (a
metadata-registered standalone like ``add_rectangle`` / ``add_point``
/ ``add_cutting_plane``, or carries a user label).  Everything else
is reaped, including stale ``_metadata`` keys whose tags no longer
exist in OCC.

This module owns no public API on its own — :meth:`_Geometry.find_orphans`
/ :meth:`_Geometry.remove_orphans` / :meth:`_Geometry.validate_pre_mesh`
are the user-facing surface; the bool / cut ops call this internally.

    1. ``model._metadata`` — every apeGmsh ``add_*`` primitive
       registers here, so a standalone rectangle / point / cutting
       plane survives.  Closed-world channel: only entries that
       apeGmsh itself wrote.
    2. apeGmsh label PG membership via :meth:`Labels.labels_for_entity`
       — catches entities the user attached to via ``g.labels.add``
       or via the ``label=`` kwarg on ``add_*``.  Tier-1
       (``_label:*``-prefixed) PGs only.
    3. **Raw user physical group membership** via

       corner point classified as orphan even though the user
