"""Error types for ADR 0038 `g.compose()` model composition.

These exceptions surface at compose time when the tag-collision
verifier or the namespace/reservation machinery detects a violation
of the merge contract.  They are intentionally narrow — one error
class per failure mode, with a clear `__str__` that names the
offending module label and the colliding identifier.

The verifier (`_tag_collision_verifier.tag_collision_verify`) and
the future Compose facade (`mesh/_compose.py`, ADR 0038 Phase 3)
both raise from this module.  Keeping the exception types in
``core/`` instead of ``mesh/`` lets the verifier — which is a
reusable primitive — be imported by both call sites without
introducing a layering cycle.

ADR 0038 §"Tag-collision verifier" pins the contract.

    Raised by checks 1, 2, and 4 of the verifier:

    - Check 1: an imported tag lands outside the module's reservation
      window (typically into the host's tag range).
    - Check 2: two modules' reservation windows overlap.
    - Check 4: a namespaced physical-group name collides with an
      existing host PG.

    The message names the offending module label and the colliding
    identifier so callers can fix the source H5 or the host author's
    PG-naming choice.

class ComposeCapacityError(RuntimeError):

    is smaller than the source's actual tag span.

    Verifier check 5.  Only fires under the explicit override —
    without an override, the auto-sizing scheme computes a window
    that fits the source by construction.

    The message names the source's span and the configured cap so
    callers can either widen the override or remove it to let the
    auto-sizing scheme do its job.

class ComposeInvariantError(RuntimeError):

    Verifier check 3.  This means either the tag-rewrite cover-set
    missed a field (an implementation bug — see ADR 0038
    §"Tag-reference rewrite checklist") or the source H5 carried a
    cross-module reference between sibling composes (forbidden in
    v1 — see ADR 0038 INV-2).

    Phase 3B.2d / ADR 0038.  Once the session has produced its first
    :class:`FEMData` (``apeGmsh._fem is not None``) the session enters
    *chain phase*: the canonical model is the broker snapshot, not the
    live gmsh state.  Geometry / mesh / PG / label / parts / sections
    mutations would diverge the broker from gmsh and silently corrupt
    downstream consumers, so the session refuses them.

    The interface-bridging primitives ``g.constraints.embedded`` /
    ``tied_contact`` / ``equalDOF`` / ``rigid_link`` / ``rigid_diaphragm``
    plus ``g.loads.X`` / ``g.masses.X`` are NOT gated — these are
    documented per ADR 0038 line 45 as the chain-phase composition
    surface and route through ``FEMData.with_*`` transforms.

    Recovery
    --------
    Reload the session from disk (``apeGmsh.from_h5(path)``) or restart
    the build phase before applying the mutation.  Chain-phase
    composition (``g.compose(...)``) is the supported way to extend a
    saved model.
