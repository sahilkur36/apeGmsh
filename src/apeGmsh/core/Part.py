Part — Pure geometry builder.  Meshing lives in the Assembly.
==============================================================

Mirrors the Abaqus Part concept:

* **Part**  =  geometry only (points, curves, surfaces, volumes).
  No meshing, no physical groups, no mesh settings.
* **Assembly**  =  imports Parts, positions them, fragments,
  assigns physical groups, controls mesh, generates mesh,
  extracts FEM data, resolves constraints.

A Part is created in its own isolated Gmsh session, geometry is
built with the full ``apeGmsh`` API, then either saved to **STEP**
explicitly or auto-persisted to an OS tempfile on exit so it can
flow straight into ``assembly.parts.add(part)``.

Typical usage
-------------
::

    from apeGmsh import Part, apeGmsh

    # ── Build a plate (auto-persisted on __exit__) ─────────────
    plate = Part("plate")
    with plate:
        p1 = plate.model.geometry.add_point(0, 0, 0)
        # ... build geometry ...

    # ── Reuse it in an apeGmsh session ────────────────────────
    g = apeGmsh(model_name="bridge")
    g.begin()
    g.parts.add(plate, translate=(0, 0, 0))
    g.parts.add(plate, translate=(5000, 0, 0), label="plate_2")
    g.parts.fragment_all()
    g.mesh.generation.generate(dim=2)
    g.end()

Auto-persist
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If ``save()`` is never called inside the ``with`` block, the Part
auto-persists its geometry to an OS tempfile on exit so it can be
consumed directly by ``assembly.parts.add(part)``.  The tempfile
is deleted when the Part object is garbage-collected or when you
call ``part.cleanup()``.  Call ``save('my.step')`` explicitly
when you want a named, persistent CAD artifact under your control
— **the library will never delete a file you named**.

Set ``auto_persist=False`` on construction to opt out.

Why STEP?
~~~~~~~~~
STEP preserves the full parametric OCC geometry (exact NURBS,
topology, tolerances).  After import, apeGmsh can:

* Apply boolean operations (fragment, fuse, cut)
* Set transfinite meshing / recombine / mesh fields
* Generate and re-generate the mesh with any settings

IGES is also supported for legacy compatibility, but STEP is
preferred (better fidelity, modern spec, avoids IGES surface
junction gaps).  Auto-persist always writes STEP.

Design notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Each Part owns its own Gmsh session.  ``begin()`` initialises
  Gmsh and creates only the composites it needs (Model, Inspect).
  ``end()`` finalises Gmsh — and, when ``auto_persist=True``,
  writes the geometry to an OS tempfile first.
* The Part remembers which file it was last saved to, so the
  Assembly can locate it automatically.
* Parts carry **metadata** in ``properties`` (thickness, material
  name, section type, etc.) that the Assembly passes through to
  the solver model.
* ``save()`` with no arguments writes ``"{name}.step"`` and
  transfers ownership of the output to the caller — if the Part
  had previously auto-persisted a tempfile, that tempfile is
  cleaned up before the explicit save runs.
