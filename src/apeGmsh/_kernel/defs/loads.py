"""Load definitions — pre-mesh user-facing intent.

Each :class:`LoadDef` subclass describes a load applied to a
geometric/PG/label target before meshing. The corresponding resolved
records (post-mesh) live in :mod:`apeGmsh.mesh.records._loads`; the
machinery that translates defs into records lives in
:mod:`apeGmsh.mesh._load_resolver`.

These classes have no Gmsh dependency, no session plumbing, and no
factory methods — pure data containers consumed by the resolver.
