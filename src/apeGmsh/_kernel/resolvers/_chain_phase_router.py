"""Chain-phase routing helpers — Phase 3B.2d / Compose v1.1-A.

When a session is in *chain phase* (``g._fem is not None``) the broker
is canonical and the legacy "store def → re-extract on next
get_fem_data()" pattern is broken: chain-phase ``get_fem_data()`` short-
circuits to the cached FEMData and never re-resolves the def lists.

This module provides the bridge: given a session whose latest broker
snapshot is ``g._fem``, plus a freshly-built definition (``BCDef`` /
``PointMassDef`` / ``EqualDOFDef`` / etc.), it resolves the def against
the FEMData via :class:`FEMDataSource` and returns a new :class:`FEMData`
with the resulting records appended via the broker's ``with_*``
transforms.

Scope
-----
The chain-phase router covers def types whose resolution can be answered
out of the broker without a live gmsh session:

* ``BCDef`` → one :class:`SPRecord` per restrained DOF per node.
* ``PointMassDef`` → one :class:`MassRecord` per resolved node.
* ``PointLoadDef`` → one :class:`NodalLoadRecord` per resolved node.

Plus the node-only interface-bridging constraints (Compose v1.1-A):

* ``EqualDOFDef`` → one :class:`NodePairRecord` per co-located pair.
* ``RigidLinkDef`` → one :class:`NodePairRecord` per slave node.
* ``RigidDiaphragmDef`` → one :class:`NodeGroupRecord`.

These use :class:`FEMDataSource.nodes_for` to resolve master/slave
labels into node-id sets, then run the same pure-Python
:class:`~apeGmsh._kernel.resolvers._constraint_resolver.ConstraintResolver`
the build-phase path uses.  No gmsh state required.

Embedded (Compose v1.1-A.2 / ADR 0041)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``EmbeddedDef`` joined the chain-phase router in v1.1-A.2 via the new
:meth:`FEMDataSource.host_subelements_for` element-side query.  The
branch resolves the host to virtual sub-tet rows, gathers embedded
nodes, drops coincident corners, and runs the same pure-numpy
:meth:`ConstraintResolver.resolve_embedded` the build-phase path
uses.  Output ``InterpolationRecord`` rows land on
``fem.elements.constraints`` via ``with_constraint(record)``.

Tied contact (Compose v1.1-A.2 PR B / ADR 0041)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``TiedContactDef`` joined the chain-phase router in v1.1-A.2 PR B via
the new :meth:`FEMDataSource.boundary_faces_for` element-side query.
The branch resolves master and slave surface labels to face-
connectivity arrays (filtering the broker's dim=2 ElementGroups by
node-ownership per ADR 0041 §"Decision 5"), pulls the master/slave
node sets via :meth:`FEMDataSource.nodes_for`, and runs the same
pure-numpy :meth:`ConstraintResolver.resolve_tied_contact` the
build-phase path uses.  Output ``SurfaceCouplingRecord`` lands on
``fem.elements.constraints`` via ``with_constraint(record)``.

Per ADR 0041 §"Decision 5", chain phase does NOT synthesize face
connectivity from volume elements — when the broker has no dim=2
ElementGroups, :meth:`boundary_faces_for` raises ``ValueError`` with
the documented "re-extract with `dim=None`" remedy.
