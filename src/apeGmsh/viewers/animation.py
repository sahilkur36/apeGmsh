"""Animation export — drive the time scrubber, capture frames, encode.

Programmatic API used by both :class:`ResultsViewer` (interactive
``viewer.export_animation(...)``) and headless scripts. Format is
auto-detected from the path suffix:

* ``.mp4`` → H.264 via ``imageio-ffmpeg`` (compact, smooth — best for
  long histories or sharing as video).
* ``.gif`` → animated GIF via Pillow (portable, embeddable in PRs and
  Slack — large file size for long histories or 24-bit color).

The export loop drives :meth:`ResultsDirector.set_step`, which already
runs the full diagram update + render pipeline, then captures the
plotter's current frame. The user's prior step is restored on
completion.

``imageio-ffmpeg`` is an optional dependency (``apegmsh[animation]``);
GIF works without it. MP4 raises a clear install hint when the wheel
is missing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plotter
        PyVista plotter the diagrams are drawing into. Must already
        have its scene built (the substrate + any active diagrams).
    director
        :class:`ResultsDirector` driving the step state. The export
        walks ``range(0, director.n_steps, step_stride)`` plus a final
        frame at ``n_steps - 1`` so the last step is always captured.
    path
        Output path. Suffix selects the format — ``.mp4`` or ``.gif``.
    fps
        Frames per second of the output. The wall-clock duration is
        ``len(captured_steps) / fps``.
    step_stride
        Skip every N-th step. Useful for long histories — a 10000-step
        run with ``step_stride=20`` yields a 500-frame animation
        (16 seconds at 30 fps) instead of a 5-minute clip.

    Returns
    -------
    Path
        The resolved output path.
