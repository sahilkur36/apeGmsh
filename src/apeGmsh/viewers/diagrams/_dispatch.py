"""ResultsViewer event-loop dispatcher.

A single-source pipeline for the four primitives that drive what the
viewport paints:

* **STEP**  — push current step values to one or all diagrams
              (``Diagram.update_to_step(step_index)``).
* **DEFORM** — recompute deformed substrate points and call
              ``Diagram.sync_substrate_points(deformed_pts, scene)`` on
              one or all diagrams. Also mutates ``scene.grid.points``
              in place when the scope is "all" so substrate-bound
              actors follow.
* **GATE**  — run the composition gate: each actor's visibility is
              ``d.is_visible AND (no_active_comp OR id(d) in active_layers)``.
* **RENDER** — single coalesced ``plotter.render()``.

Every UI gesture / observer / shortcut funnels through
``Dispatcher.fire(event_kind, ...)`` which selects the right primitive
sequence from the event matrix. This is the only place those four
primitives may run.

Every dispatch fires through ``apeGmsh.viewers._log.log_action``
(category ``dispatch``). The session log file captures the full
sequence with timestamps + duration; bug reports attach the most
recent file and we replay every gesture.

The granular ``geometry_*`` / ``composition_changed`` rows fire from
``GeometryManager.subscribe_typed`` / ``CompositionManager`` mutations
with the relevant id as ``payload``. When one of them fires in the
same notification chain as the omnibus ``geometries_changed``, the
omnibus is suppressed — the granular row already runs the right pump.

The Phase-3 ``element_visibility_changed`` / ``opacity_changed`` /
``pick_mode_changed`` events run no pump. They exist to fan-out to
RENDER-lane subscribers — cell-ghost flips, actor opacity updates,
``SetPickable`` toggles. ``pick_mode_changed`` further skips the
closing ``render()`` because pickability isn't visually observable
(the next pick gesture sees the new flags).

``session_batch(...)`` is a context manager that suppresses every
primitive in between, then runs one full pump on exit. Use it during
``_apply_session`` to kill the N-squared registry pump.
``gesture_batch(...)`` is its interactive-cascade sibling: on exit it
replays only the matrix-row **union** of the kinds suppressed inside
the block (ADR 0056 Part 2) — an N-layer eye cascade costs one gate
pump + one render, not N.

ADR 0056 Part 3: the Director constructs this dispatcher at
``__init__`` with no-op pumps, so ``director.dispatcher`` always
exists; the viewer rebinds the real pumps via :meth:`Dispatcher.bind`
at ``show()``. Owner mutators (``DiagramRegistry.set_visible``, the
geometry/composition managers, ``ElementVisibility``) fire their own
events — call sites only call mutators.
