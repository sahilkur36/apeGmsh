"""ResultsDirector — single source of truth for stage / step / registry.

The Director owns:

* ``results`` — the bound Results object.
* ``stage_id`` — currently active stage (None until set).
* ``step_index`` — currently active time-step index within that stage.
* ``time_mode`` — ``"single" | "range" | "envelope" | "animation"``
  (Phase 0 ships ``"single"`` only; the others arrive in Phase 6).
* ``registry`` — the DiagramRegistry.

UI tabs subscribe to Director observers (``on_step_changed``,
``on_stage_changed``, ``on_diagrams_changed``); user actions flow back
through Director methods.

Observer chain is **UI -> Director -> Diagrams**. A diagram never
calls ``director.set_step(...)``; that would create a feedback loop.

Phase 8 (ADR 0020) — :meth:`set_model` is the chain-forward binder
that accepts an :class:`OpenSeesModel` handle (cuts iteration source).
The director keeps a ``_model_h5`` file path internally for the
:class:`FemToOpsTagMap` build (still path-based by current contract),
bound through the private :meth:`_bind_model_h5` helper at viewer
boot / session restore.  AST guard (ADR 0014 INV-2): the
``OpenSeesModel`` type is referenced only under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` with
a string annotation, never imported at module level.
