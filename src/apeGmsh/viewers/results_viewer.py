"""ResultsViewer — the post-solve interactive viewer.

Opens against a :class:`Results` instance and renders the bound
``FEMData`` mesh.

Parallel to :class:`MeshViewer` (pre-solve) and :class:`ModelViewer`
(BRep geometry). Reuses the same ``viewers/scene/``, ``viewers/core/``,
and ``viewers/ui/`` infrastructure where possible.

Phase 8 (ADR 0020 INV-1) — :class:`Results` carries the
:class:`OpenSeesModel` natively via :attr:`Results.model` (always
non-None post-prune).  The viewer reads structural data from the
chain-forward handle; cuts auto-load and orientation auto-resolve
are gated on ``results.model`` (always populated).

Usage::

    from apeGmsh import Results
    from apeGmsh.opensees import OpenSeesModel

    model = OpenSeesModel.from_h5("model.h5")
    results = Results.from_native("run.h5", model=model)
    results.viewer()                       # blocks until window closes
    results.viewer(blocking=False)         # subprocess
