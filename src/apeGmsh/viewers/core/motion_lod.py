"""MotionLOD — hide heavy actors while the camera is moving.

ParaView-style level-of-detail: during an interactive camera gesture
(orbit / pan / wheel-zoom) the most expensive per-frame actors are
hidden so frames stay cheap; ~``settle_ms`` after the last camera
change the full-detail scene is restored with a single render.

One ``ModifiedEvent`` observer on the active camera catches *every*
camera motion path uniformly — the custom Shift/MMB orbit, the VTK
trackball pan, and wheel zoom all modify the camera — so no
per-gesture wiring into ``navigation`` is needed.

Usage::

    lod = MotionLOD(plotter, lambda: registry.dim_node_actors.values())
    lod.install()

    Parameters
    ----------
    plotter
        The pyvista/Qt plotter (needs ``.renderer`` and ``.render()``).
    get_actors
        Callable returning the vtk actors to hide while moving. Called
        fresh on every motion-start so it tracks actor swaps (e.g. the
        node cloud is rebuilt on a point-size change).
    settle_ms
        Idle time after the last camera change before full detail is
        restored. 120 ms ≈ imperceptible yet long enough to bridge the
        gaps between mouse-move events during a drag.
