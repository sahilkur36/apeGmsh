"""PickInventory for ResultsViewer — actor inventory for pick routing.

Diagrams that own a 3-D pickable actor register themselves on attach so
the results-pick controller can route a ``vtkCellPicker`` hit back to the
diagram-specific ``(element_id, sub_index, …)`` result without walking
every active diagram on every click.

Currently registered:

* :class:`GaussPointDiagram` with ``kind="gp"``. Reverse-map returns
  ``(element_id, gp_index, world_xyz)``.

:class:`FiberSectionDiagram` is intentionally NOT registered — its
3-D point cloud sets ``pickable=False`` so picks pass through to the
substrate. Fiber selection happens through the 2-D side panel.

ADR 0047 R-D.2b — clean redesign: the per-mode allow-list + ``SetPickable``
flipping (``set_pick_mode`` / ``_MODE_ALLOW``) and the ``Alt``-pick-through
context manager are **gone**. They were dead in production: ``set_pick_mode``
had zero callers, so ``register_actor`` left every GP marker stuck
non-pickable (``_MODE_ALLOW[NODE]`` is empty) and GP picking only worked
when the user held ``Alt`` (which force-enabled everything). Registered
actors now simply stay pickable; the pick controller routes a hit by the
current mode + which actor was hit at *resolve* time. This is a pure
inventory — no VTK, no mode state.
