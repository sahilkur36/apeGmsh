"""Stage-activation hidden-cell masks (ADR 0055 viewer-consume, V1).

Maps the staged-analysis PROGRAM (``OpenSeesModel.stages()`` →
``StageRecordRO``, persisted under ``/opensees/stages``) onto the
results substrate grid: which cells exist while each analysis stage is
selected in the viewer.

Semantics (mirrors the bridge's ``_emit_stages_flat`` order)::

    active(K) = global ∪ owned(stages 1..K) − removed(stages 1..K)

A stage's ``remove_elements`` emit at stage start (before its analyze
loop), so a removed element is hidden IN its removing stage, not after
it.  Elements owned by no stage (global topology) are visible in every
stage unless removed.

The program records carry RESOLVED OpenSees element tags; the grid is
keyed by broker FEM element ids (``cell_data["element_id"]`` /
``FEMSceneData.element_id_to_cell``).  The ops-tag → fem-eid join
comes from the model's :class:`ElementRecord` rows (``fem_eid``,
rehydrated from ``/opensees/element_meta``).  Tags that cannot be
mapped (``fem_eid`` sentinel ``-1``, unknown tag, eid not in the grid)
are skipped and counted — the viewer is a read-only consumer, so the
filter degrades open (fail-soft) instead of raising.

Capture stages (the results-zone ``/stages``, ``StageInfo.name``) and
program stages are linked BY NAME (user convention; nothing enforces
a match), with a POSITIONAL fallback via
:func:`pair_capture_to_program` for MPCO/Ladruno captures (their
stage names are ``MODEL_STAGE[<stamp>]``, never equal to program
names — applies only when no name matches and the counts line up).
:meth:`StageActivationMap.mask_for` returns ``None`` for unmatched
names — callers clear the layer so the stage renders unfiltered.
Duplicate program-stage names keep the LAST stage's mask
(registration order), matching how a name-keyed lookup must collapse
them.
