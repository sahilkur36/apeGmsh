"""
``section Aggregator`` — couple a uniaxial response to each DOF.

The OpenSees Tcl command::

    section Aggregator $tag $matTag1 $code1 $matTag2 $code2 ...
                       <-section $sectionTag>

stitches one :class:`UniaxialMaterial` per force/moment code, optionally
layered on top of a base :class:`Section` (whose other DOFs pass
through).  ``$code`` is one of:

* ``P`` — axial force / axial deformation
* ``Vy`` / ``Vz`` — shear forces along the local y / z axes
* ``T`` — torsion
* ``My`` / ``Mz`` — bending moments about the local y / z axes

For an aggregator built purely from uniaxials (no base section), every
non-zero DOF in the response must have a material assigned;
unassigned DOFs are infinitely stiff (OpenSees defaults to a
zero-displacement constraint at those DOFs).

    """``section Aggregator`` — DOF-wise uniaxial coupling.

    Each DOF in ``materials_by_dof`` is coupled to its associated
    :class:`UniaxialMaterial`; when ``base_section`` is non-``None``,
    the aggregator layers these on top of the base section's response
    for the listed DOFs and falls back to the base section's response
    on every other DOF.

    Parameters
    ----------
    materials_by_dof
        Mapping from one of :data:`AGGREGATOR_DOF_CODES` to a typed
        :class:`UniaxialMaterial` primitive.  Insertion order is
        preserved in the emitted command (Python's dict order
        guarantee).  At least one entry is required.
    base_section
        Optional :class:`Section` providing the response on DOFs not
        covered by ``materials_by_dof``.  When ``None`` the aggregator
        is "pure" — unlisted DOFs are infinitely stiff.

    Notes
    -----
    The aggregator emits with the materials in the dict's insertion
    order — this is the order the user typed them.  Mixing keys
    (e.g. ``{"Mz": k_phi, "P": k_N}``) is legal and matches OpenSees
    semantics (the parser is order-independent on the code/tag
    pairs).

    Use case anchor — the S3-splice macro-model from Cerro Lindo
    Pasada 3a binding C.4 couples ``Mz`` (rotational spring) with
    ``P`` (axial slip-bearing) and ``Vy`` (frictional shear) in a
    single ``zeroLengthSection`` element via this primitive.
