"""
Base classes for typed primitives.

``Primitive`` is the abstract root. Concrete leaf classes (``Steel02``,
``Fiber``, ``forceBeamColumn``, …) inherit from one of the family
bases (``UniaxialMaterial``, ``Section``, ``Element``, …) and become
``@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True)``.

Combining ``abc.ABC`` with slotted frozen dataclasses requires care:
slots conflict with ``__dict__``, and frozen dataclasses inherit their
slot layout. Rather than fighting that, we keep the ABC parents
**non-dataclass** plain classes that only declare the abstract method
surface. Concrete subclasses become dataclasses one level down. This
is the pattern used elsewhere in the apeGmsh codebase.

The Protocol type is imported behind ``TYPE_CHECKING`` to avoid a
runtime cycle (``emitter`` package re-exports nothing from here, so
the static reference is sufficient).
