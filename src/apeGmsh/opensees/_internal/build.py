"""
Phase-4 build pipeline helpers.

The bridge's ``BuiltModel.emit`` orchestrates emission, but the
non-trivial work — dependency-sorted ordering, element fan-out across
physical groups, orientation-derived per-element ``vecxz`` fan-out,
and pattern / recorder ``pg=`` fan-out — lives here as pure helpers
so the orchestration in :mod:`apesees` stays small and readable.

The helpers in this module never import :mod:`openseespy`; they speak
only to the frozen :class:`Emitter` Protocol via the bridge-attached
tag resolver and element-nodes context (see
:mod:`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.tag_resolution`).

Three deferred contracts are resolved here:

  1. **Element fan-out** across a physical group's element ids and
     connectivity (the bridge writes the per-element node tags into the
     emitter's ``_current_element_nodes`` slot, allocates a per-element
     tag, and drives ``spec._emit`` once per element).

  2. **orientation-derived per-element vecxz fan-out** (ADR 0010):
     when a ``Linear`` / ``PDelta`` / ``Corotational`` GeomTransf is
     constructed with ``orientation=`` rather than an explicit
     ``vecxz=``, the bridge computes the local tangent for each
     element in the transform-bearing PGs, queries the orientation
     triad at the element midpoint, resolves the per-element
     ``vecxz`` via :func:`resolve_vecxz`, and emits one
     ``geomTransf`` line per distinct ``vecxz`` (within a ``1e-9``
     tolerance), reusing the same geomTransf tag for elements whose
     vecxz matches.

  3. **Pattern / recorder ``pg=`` fan-out** to per-node and per-element
     tags: the bridge resolves ``pg=`` records on :class:`Plain`
     patterns (loads + sps) and on Node / Element recorders into
     concrete tag lists before driving each primitive's ``_emit``.

    Per ADR 0022 INV-5 this pass runs between element emission and
    pattern emission in :meth:`BuiltModel.emit`.

    Ordering (INV-3 / dependency-driven):

    1. **Phantom-node pre-step** — :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord` rows
       carry synthetic 6-DOF phantom nodes whose tags must exist in
       the OpenSees domain before any constraint references them.
       Emitted via ``emitter.node(tag, *xyz, ndf=6)`` — the standard
       OpenSees per-node ``-ndf`` override pattern.  Tags are
       de-duplicated across records (paranoid; the resolver does not
       collide, but the cost of the set check is negligible).

    2. **Rigid links** — :meth:`fem.nodes.constraints.rigid_link_groups`
       yields ``(master, slaves)`` tuples covering ``rigid_beam`` /
       ``rigid_rod`` :class:`NodePairRecord` rows, the ``rigid_body``
       slaves on :class:`NodeGroupRecord`, and the phantom-side
       rigid-link rows on :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord`.  Emitted as
       one ``emitter.rigidLink('beam'|'bar', master, slave)`` per
       slave; ``rigid_rod`` maps to ``"bar"`` per the OpenSees
       vocabulary.

    3. **Equal DOFs** — :meth:`fem.nodes.constraints.equal_dofs`
       yields :class:`NodePairRecord` rows for ``equal_dof`` plus the
       phantom→slave equal-DOF rows nested under
       :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord`.  Emitted as one
       ``emitter.equalDOF(master, slave, *dofs)`` per record.

    4. **Rigid diaphragms** — :meth:`fem.nodes.constraints.rigid_diaphragms`
       yields ``(perp_dir, master, slaves)`` for
       :class:`NodeGroupRecord` rows with kind ``rigid_diaphragm``.
       Emitted as one ``emitter.rigidDiaphragm(perp_dir, master,
       *slaves)`` per record.

    5. **Kinematic couplings** — :class:`NodeGroupRecord` rows with
       kind ``kinematic_coupling`` are emitted as one ``equalDOF``
       per ``(master, slave)`` pair (the per-DOF selectivity makes
       ``rigidLink`` / ``rigidDiaphragm`` wrong for this family —
       see the docstring on :meth:`rigid_link_groups`).

    6. **Surface couplings** — :meth:`fem.elements.constraints.interpolations`
       yields :class:`InterpolationRecord` rows (one slave node ↔ N
       weighted master nodes from a master element face).  Emitted as
       one ``emitter.embeddedNode(ele_tag, cnode, *args)``
       per record using a freshly allocated element tag.  Covers
       ``tie`` / ``distributing`` / ``embedded`` directly and
       ``tied_contact`` / ``mortar`` via the
       :meth:`SurfaceCouplingRecord.slave_records` expansion that
       ``interpolations()`` performs internally.

    Each constraint with a non-empty ``name`` is preceded by
    ``emitter.mp_constraint_comment(name)`` so the user's declaration
    label round-trips into emitted Tcl / Py via the ``# {name}`` line
    (INV-2).

    No-op when the FEM snapshot exposes no ``nodes.constraints`` or
    ``elements.constraints`` accessors — broker constraints are
    purely additive on top of any other bridge state.
