"""
Phase-4 build pipeline helpers.

The bridge's ``BuiltModel.emit`` orchestrates emission, but the
non-trivial work — dependency-sorted ordering, element fan-out across
physical groups, csys-derived per-element ``vecxz`` fan-out, and
pattern / recorder ``pg=`` fan-out — lives here as pure helpers so
the orchestration in :mod:`apesees` stays small and readable.

The helpers in this module never import :mod:`openseespy`; they speak
only to the frozen :class:`Emitter` Protocol via the bridge-attached
tag resolver and element-nodes context (see
:mod:`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.tag_resolution`).

Three deferred contracts are resolved here:

  1. **Element fan-out** across a physical group's element ids and
     connectivity (the bridge writes the per-element node tags into the
     emitter's ``_current_element_nodes`` slot, allocates a per-element
     tag, and drives ``spec._emit`` once per element).

  2. **csys-derived per-element vecxz fan-out** (ADR 0010): when a
     ``Linear`` / ``PDelta`` / ``Corotational`` GeomTransf is constructed
     with ``csys=`` rather than an explicit ``vecxz=``, the bridge
     computes the local tangent for each element in the
     transform-bearing PGs, queries the CS triad at the element midpoint,
     resolves the per-element ``vecxz`` via :func:`resolve_vecxz`, and
     emits one ``geomTransf`` line per distinct ``vecxz`` (within a
     ``1e-9`` tolerance), reusing the same geomTransf tag for elements
     whose vecxz matches.

  3. **Pattern / recorder ``pg=`` fan-out** to per-node and per-element
     tags: the bridge resolves ``pg=`` records on :class:`Plain`
     patterns (loads + sps) and on Node / Element recorders into
     concrete tag lists before driving each primitive's ``_emit``.
