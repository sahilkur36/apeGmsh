# Deferred items

Things we've discussed and consciously held for later. Not bugs, not
backlog — concrete capability ideas that earn their own scope when a
real model needs them.

## Node aggregator capabilities (v1 ships lean)

`Node` ships:

- `.coords`, `.tag`
- `.fix(dofs=...)` (model-level)
- `.mass(values=...)` (model-level)
- `.load(forces=...)` inside a pattern context
- `.region(name)` — assign the node to a named OpenSees Region;
  ships on top of the `Emitter.region()` Protocol method from
  ADR 0024.

Held for later, in priority order:

1. **`.disp_history()` / `.element.disp_history()`** — pull recorder
   output for a node or element after analysis.  Requires a
   registered :class:`Recorder` matching the query; the typed
   query layer composes over the existing Recorders system.
2. **`.get_reaction()`** — query post-analysis reaction forces.
3. **`.coupled_dofs()`** — list MP_Constraints that touch this node
   (rigid links, equal_dof, etc.).
4. **`.partition`** — owning partition tag for parallel runs.

## Asymmetric-section warning at `geomTransf` build

Today's CS resolver in `_orientation.py::resolve_vecxz` emits the
correct vecxz, but the leg sign-flip on arches is inherent. For
symmetric sections (W12, RHS, circular HSS) the sign flip is
harmless. For asymmetric sections (channels, angles, T-sections)
it produces inconsistent physical orientation across the legs.

Deferred capability:

- At build time, detect when an element using an asymmetric section
  hits the degenerate branch (the `else` arm at
  `_orientation.py:462-465`).
- Emit a warning naming the affected PG and suggesting `roll_deg`
  on one of the legs.

Lives in `_internal/build.py::emit_transform_specs` (around the
`compute_vecxz_for_element` call at line 601) once we get there.

**Load-bearing blocker — needs a section asymmetry predicate.**
The detection requires knowing "is the section attached to this
element asymmetric." Today the section primitives (`Fiber`,
`Elastic`, `LayeredShell`, ...) carry no `is_asymmetric` field and
class name alone is not a signal — a `Fiber` section can hold a W14
patch (symmetric) or a channel/angle patch (asymmetric). The clean
trigger for this work is one of:

- A future typed `Channel` / `Angle` / `Tee` section primitive
  that carries the discriminator natively.
- apeSteel-section metadata being plumbed into the bridge so the
  `apeSteel.SingleAngleSection` / `ChannelSection` / `TeeSection`
  classes propagate `is_asymmetric=True` through to the bridge.
- A geometric-fiber-layout audit on `Fiber` sections that infers
  asymmetry from the patch / fiber positions (more fragile).

Don't implement against the current section types — a class-name
whitelist would either be too noisy (warn on every `Fiber`) or
miss cases (only typed primitives, none of which exist yet).

## Custom convergence / retry recipes

`apeSees` ships recipes for the common cases:

- `Static.linear(steps=...)`
- `Static.load_control(...)`
- `Static.disp_control(...)`
- `Transient.newmark(...)`
- `Transient.hht(...)`

Held for later:

- A `RetryStrategy` primitive that lets users compose convergence
  recovery (line search → reduce step → switch algorithm). For now,
  users who need this drop to live mode and write the loop
  themselves: `bm = ops.build(); bm.run_live(analysis=None)`.

## Multi-pattern aggregation

`Pattern` instances aggregate their loads after the `with` block
closes. A future capability is cross-pattern queries on a Node:
"show me every load this node has received across all patterns."
Defer until users ask.

## ANSYS / Code_Aster / JSON emit targets

The `Emitter` Protocol is designed to support more targets (P8).
None planned for v1. The first non-OpenSees target is the test of
whether the abstraction was right; we'll know when we get there.

## Code-generated namespace methods

The signature duplication between typed dataclass and namespace
method (ADR 0003) is hand-written for v1. If it becomes painful as
the type catalog grows, generate the namespace from the typed
classes via introspection.

## Staged-analysis follow-ups

The SSI feature set ([ADR
0028](decisions/0028-initial-stress-via-parameter-ramping.md) /
[0029](decisions/0029-staged-analysis-context-manager.md) /
[0030](decisions/0030-stage-bound-topology-activation.md) /
[0031](decisions/0031-ssi-convenience-helpers.md) /
[0034](decisions/0034-stage-bound-bcs-and-recorders.md)) ships the
declarative `ops.stage(name)` / `s.activate(pgs=)` /
`s.fix(...)` / `s.mass(...)` / `s.region(...)` / `s.recorder(...)` /
`ops.initial_stress(...)` surface, the runnable Tcl / Py text
emit, the combined partitioned + staged emit (Phase SSI-2.C), and
the four-validator ownership-tier surface (Phase SSI-2.D).
Follow-ups still explicitly deferred:

### Live execution of staged models

`apeSees.analyze` and `apeSees.eigen` refuse staged models with
`NotImplementedError`. `LiveOpsEmitter.stage_open` /
`stage_close` raise. Lifting requires staging the analysis-chain
re-binding, per-stage `analyze` loops, `loadConst` / `wipeAnalysis`
interleaving, and hook-list clearing inside the live emitter. The
contract is documented (ADR 0029 §"Stage-close cleanup contract");
the implementation is the missing piece.

The workaround is `ops.tcl(p, run=True)` / `ops.py(p, run=True)` —
the OpenSees subprocess runs every stage's analyze loop and
inter-stage cleanup as part of executing the deck. The Cerro
Lindo migration uses this; live execution is the ergonomic gap.

Lives in `emitter/live.py::stage_open` / `stage_close` (currently
raise); `apesees.py::analyze` / `eigen` (currently refuse).

### H5 archival of staged structure + initial-stress

`H5Emitter.addToParameter` / `step_hook_ramp` / `stage_open` /
`stage_close` / `domain_change` are no-ops — staged structure and
the in-situ stress ramp are not persisted by the per-zone
`/opensees/` schema today. Because a silent-drop H5 round-trip
would produce a non-staged flat model that no longer matches the
declared one, `apeSees.h5(path)` is **guarded**: it raises
`NotImplementedError` (#313) when `self._stage_records` or
`self._initial_stress_records` is non-empty, pointing the user at
`ops.tcl(path)` / `ops.py(path)` instead. The H5 emitter-side
no-ops remain reachable from direct `H5Emitter` unit tests outside
the bridge; the guard is at the user-facing `apeSees.h5`.

A future schema bump (per [ADR
0023](decisions/0023-per-zone-schema-versioning.md)) bringing
`opensees_schema_version` from `2.11.0` → `2.12.0` would persist
per-stage primitive lists and initial-stress records under
`/opensees/stages/` and `/opensees/initial_stress/`, lift the
guard, and restore round-trip parity. Open design questions
before that lands:

- Persistence shape for the per-step ramp proc. Three plausible
  readings: serialise the `(name, targets, n_steps_to_full,
  phase)` tuple (lossless re-emit on read); persist the rendered
  Tcl/Py body bytes (only useful for textual re-emit, not for
  live replay); persist the `InitialStressRecord` pre-resolve (the
  cleanest — re-runs `emit_initial_stress_global` on read).
- How a viewer would render staged state. `Results.viewer()`
  currently shows a single time-history slab; staged decks have a
  per-stage analyze loop with reset pseudo-time. Likely needs a
  `Stage` discriminator on the slab.

Lives in `apesees.py::h5` (the bridge-side guard, #313) and
`emitter/h5.py::addToParameter` / `step_hook_ramp` / `stage_open`
/ `stage_close` / `domain_change` (the schema-side no-ops).

### `remove sp` / mass-zero-out across stages

Stage-bound BCs declared via `s.fix(...)` / `s.mass(...)` are
APPEND-ONLY in Phase SSI-2.D. A stage cannot release a prior
stage's SP constraint or zero out a prior stage's mass through
the builder. For excavation-style decks that genuinely need to
release support during construction (e.g. removing a temporary
shoring fix between stages), users currently drop to raw Tcl for
the release step.

Lifting requires a new `s.remove_sp(*, pg=None, nodes=None,
dofs)` verb (emits `remove sp $node $dof`) and a
`s.zero_mass(*, pg=None, nodes=None)` verb (emits
`node $N mass 0 0 0`). Both would extend `StageRecord` with
removal-records fields and a per-stage emit pass running
alongside the existing `s.fix` / `s.mass` pass.

Open design question: should removals queue on a per-stage
"release list" that emits BEFORE the stage's new BCs, or AFTER?
Before is the conservative reading (release the old, then apply
the new); after lets a stage atomically replace a BC by issuing
`remove sp` + `fix` for the same target.

Lives in `apesees.py::_StageBuilder` (would gain the new verbs)
and the stage emit blocks in `_emit_stages_flat` /
`_emit_stages_partitioned`.

### MPCO recorders with filters under stages

Stage-bound MPCO recorders DO claim through `s.recorder(spec)`
but the per-rank filter-region planning
(`_plan_partitioned_mpco_recorders`) currently only runs in the
global emit pass. A stage-bound MPCO with a `nodes_pg=` /
`elements_pg=` filter would fall through `emit_recorder_spec`'s
materialize path and emit the filter region INSIDE the stage
block instead of pre-allocated — works but doesn't reuse the
cross-rank tag-identity infrastructure.

Lifting: pre-allocate stage MPCO filter regions alongside the
per-stage region tag cache; thread `_region_tag` into the
materialised spec the same way the global path does at
`apesees.py::_plan_partitioned_mpco_recorders`.

Trigger this work when a real consumer needs stage-bound MPCO
with filters under MP. Today's call sites use whole-model MPCO
(no filter) or filtered MPCO at global scope only.

### `s.tied_contact` / `s.mortar` stage-bound claim

The Phase SSI-2.D extension (ADR 0034 §5a) ships nine claim-by-
name methods on `_StageBuilder` (`s.embedded`, `s.equal_dof`,
`s.rigid_link`, `s.rigid_diaphragm`, `s.kinematic_coupling`,
`s.tie`, `s.distributing`, `s.node_to_surface`,
`s.node_to_surface_spring`) — but `s.tied_contact` and `s.mortar`
are intentionally omitted:

- **`s.tied_contact`** — `tied_contact` records resolve to a
  `SurfaceCouplingRecord` whose nested `slave_records: list[
  InterpolationRecord]` is what actually emits via the
  `interpolations()` iterator at global emit time. The
  `_ExcludeClaimedConstraints` filter operates on outer-record
  identity (`id(rec)` of the `SurfaceCouplingRecord`); the nested
  slaves have distinct ids and slip through the global exclusion
  filter. Result: claiming a `tied_contact` by id would leave the
  slave interpolations emitting in BOTH the global pre-stage pass
  AND the stage block — double emission, which crashes OpenSees
  with duplicate element tag.
- **`s.mortar`** — kernel-side `g.constraints.mortar(...)` raises
  `NotImplementedError` ([ConstraintsComposite.py:1180](../../core/ConstraintsComposite.py))
  pending a real implementation of the ∫ψ·N dΓ Lagrange-multiplier
  coupling; the stage-bound claim version stays deferred until
  there are records to claim.

Lifting `s.tied_contact`: extend `_ExcludeClaimedConstraints.
interpolations()` to also filter nested slaves when their parent
`SurfaceCouplingRecord` is claimed (probably by carrying a
parent-id map alongside the claim set), or claim individual
slave InterpolationRecord ids directly (requires the user to
name the slaves, which isn't ergonomic).

Trigger this work when an SSI deck legitimately needs to stage-
bind a `tied_contact` interface — most lining/excavation models
use `embedded` (volume host) or `tie` (surface host) instead.

### Implicit promotion of `g.constraints.*` records to stages (Path A)

The Phase SSI-2.D extension shipped CLAIM-by-name (Path D2 from
the scoping conversation) rather than implicit derivation in
`compute_stage_ownership` (Path A). The forgotten-claim failure
mode — user adds a new embed at apeGmsh time, forgets to claim
it inside the appropriate stage block, deck routes it to the
global pre-stage pass and crashes when stage-bound nodes don't
exist yet at parse time — was the principal critique against the
shipped approach. Today the V1-style ownership-tier validator
catches the resulting "stage N node referenced by global record"
failure with a clear offender list, but the user still has to
edit the stage block to fix it.

Lifting via implicit promotion would extend
`compute_stage_ownership` to walk constraint records and promote
them to a stage when ALL referenced nodes resolve to that stage's
node ownership (and fail loud on cross-stage spans). Architectural
concerns flagged in the scoping critique: (a) it's a "third
pattern" relative to ADR 0034's PUSH/PULL/CLAIM trichotomy;
(b) PG is the authoring spine — implicit promotion arguably
matches the existing pattern (materials/sections/loads/masses
all derive from PG ownership). The CLAIM-by-name shipping
decision was driven by the wish to keep the architecture surface
narrow (and to ship sooner for the Cerro Lindo SSI V5 forcing
function).

Trigger this work if the forgotten-claim failure becomes a real
authoring footgun across SSI decks (more than the occasional
"oops, forgot `name=`"). Likely won't lift soon — CLAIM-by-name
covers the canonical SSI workflow ergonomically, and Path A's
"third pattern" concern from the architecture critics still
holds.

Lives in `_internal/build.py::compute_stage_ownership` (would
gain constraint-record promotion logic) + `apesees.py::
_run_staged_bc_validators` (a new V6 for cross-stage spans).

## Cylindrical / Spherical in 2-D models

`Cylindrical(axis=(0,0,1))` for a 2-D model would be meaningful
(in-plane radial / circumferential axes — both lie in the
xy-plane when the axis is perpendicular to it).  `Spherical` is
intrinsically 3-D and stays out of scope.

Today the build step raises :class:`BridgeError` when
``orientation=`` is supplied with ``ndm=2`` (see
`_internal/build.py::emit_transform_specs`).  This is the
defensive landing — the path used to silently produce an invalid
deck (``geomTransf Linear $tag $x $y $z`` with a 3-component
vecxz tail, which OpenSees rejects at parse time).  Refusing
loudly is correct until the lift lands.

To lift the restriction:

1. Decide what `orientation=Cylindrical(axis=(0,0,1))` *means*
   in OpenSees 2-D, given that 2-D `geomTransf` takes no vecxz
   argument.  Two plausible readings:
   - **Silently drop the orientation** (emit the bare 2-D form).
     Cheap; arguably surprising because the user supplied
     orientation explicitly.
   - **Use the orientation for downstream metadata** (e.g. the
     viewer's local-axis overlay, or a future curved-beam
     section orientation) but still emit the bare form.  Needs
     a downstream consumer to justify the work.
3. Add a 2-D + `Cylindrical(axis=(0,0,1))` end-to-end test
   exercising whichever semantics land (no test exists today —
   the existing 2-D tests at
   `tests/opensees/integration/test_full_emit_recording.py::test_2d_geomtransf_*`
   only cover the bare path and the new raise).
4. Drop the raise in `emit_transform_specs`.

Don't implement until at least one consumer needs in-plane
orientation metadata — the silent-drop interpretation is
indistinguishable from no orientation at all.

## Higher-order embedded coupling via `HostProjector` (RFC)

`g.constraints.embedded(...)` today couples each embedded node to
3 or 4 corner nodes of a sub-tri / sub-tet via linear barycentric
shape functions (ADR 0036 — the "linear-over-corners" contract).
The decomposition makes non-simplex / higher-order hosts
*structurally* embeddable, but the embedded node never feels the
host's native interpolation richness:

- An LST plate's quadratic curvature is discarded.
- A hex8's bilinear twist mode is discarded.
- A quad9 / hex20's biquadratic / triquadratic field is discarded.

For most rebar-in-concrete cases this is fine — the embed is so
much stiffer than the host that the global kinematic link
dominates. For cases where the host's higher-order field is doing
real work (LST plate intentionally chosen for bending; fibre in a
quad9 stress-concentration patch), the linear projection throws
away the accuracy gain.

The `host_coupling=` keyword on
[`EmbeddedDef`][apeGmsh._kernel.defs.constraints.EmbeddedDef] is
reserved for this: only `"linear"` is accepted today, but the
field, factory keyword, and `__post_init__` guard are all in
place so a future `"trilinear"` / `"biquadratic"` option can
land without breaking old models.

### What "doing it properly" requires

The clean architectural fix is a `HostProjector` strategy
interface — each gmsh etype gets its own projector that owns:

1. **Point location** in the host's natural coordinates
   (trilinear inverse-map for hex8; biquadratic inverse for
   quad9; etc.). Today's `_barycentric_tri3` /
   `_barycentric_tet4` only cover the simplex case.
2. **Coupling weights** evaluated against the host's native
   shape functions at the located parametric point. Today the
   weights are linear barycentric over 3 / 4 corners; the
   higher-fidelity branch would produce 8 weights for hex8
   trilinear coupling, 9 for quad9 biquadratic, etc.

### What it requires on the OpenSees side

Native N-node retained-set coupling needs new element classes:

- **`ASDEmbeddedHex8Element`** — 1 constrained + 8 retained =
  9 nodes total. `getTangentStiff` builds the penalty matrix
  using trilinear shape functions evaluated at the embedded
  node's local (ξ, η, ζ) coordinates. Mirrors the existing
  `TET_3D_U` / `TET_3D_UR` / `TET_3D_UP` triplet but on a
  9-node `m_nodes` vector.
- **`ASDEmbeddedQuad4Element`** — 1 + 4 = 5 nodes; bilinear
  shape functions. The 2D analogue.
- (Optional) `ASDEmbeddedHex20Element` / `ASDEmbeddedQuad9Element`
  for true higher-order coupling. Lower priority — most users
  who need higher-fidelity embed will be on hex8 / quad4 hosts.

Element-registration burden per new class:

- `classTags.h` entry.
- `OPS_ASDEmbeddedHex8` factory in `elementAPI.h`.
- `FEM_ObjectBroker::getNewElement` dispatch.
- `sendSelf` / `recvSelf` for parallel runs (mirroring the
  existing `ASDEmbeddedNodeElement::sendSelf` at
  [cpp:649-714](https://github.com/OpenSees/OpenSees/blob/master/SRC/element/CEqElement/ASDEmbeddedNodeElement.cpp)).
- CMake registration (`SRC/element/CEqElement/CMakeLists.txt`).

Coordinate-management with ASDEA (Massimo Petracca authored the
original `ASDEmbeddedNodeElement`) before opening upstream PRs.

### What it requires on the apeGmsh side

Once the OpenSees side has the new element classes:

- Accept `host_coupling="trilinear"` / `"biquadratic"` on
  `EmbeddedDef.__post_init__` (drop the current
  `host_coupling != "linear"` raise).
- In `_collect_host_subelements`, skip decomposition for hosts
  whose coupling mode is `"trilinear"` (return the native hex8
  rows of shape `(n, 8)`) or `"biquadratic"` (return native
  quad9 rows of shape `(n, 9)`).
- Widen the resolver's `npe in (3, 4)` check to `npe in (3, 4,
  8, 9)` with dispatch to new `_inverse_map_hex8` /
  `_inverse_map_quad9` functions. The inverse maps are
  iterative (Newton on the host shape functions); not trivial
  but well-trodden territory — see Hughes §3.7 or any FEM text.
- Emitter side (`opensees/emitter/*.py`): route
  `InterpolationRecord` with `n_masters in (8, 9)` to the new
  element class instead of `ASDEmbeddedNodeElement`.

### Trigger conditions

Don't start until one of these lands:

- A real user model where the linear-over-corners projection is
  measurably wrong (mesh-refinement study shows the embed
  results don't converge to the higher-order host's reference
  solution). Saying "this is theoretically lossy" is not enough
  — Cerro Lindo-style tunnel models with rebar in rock have
  shipped on the linear coupling and converged.
- A research project that explicitly needs the higher-order
  coupling (e.g., a paper on fibre-reinforced composite
  modelling where the matrix's quadratic field matters for
  the fibre's stress state).
- ASDEA volunteers to maintain a trilinear coupling element
  upstream (would change the cost calculus by removing the
  coordination burden).

The reserved `host_coupling=` keyword is the no-cost hook that
makes this future PR a non-breaking change. The work itself is
~2-3 months of coordinated OpenSees + apeGmsh changes plus a
real test suite (convergence study against a known
trilinear-coupled reference) — only worth it when a real model
needs it.
