# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Each ADR captures one significant decision: the **context** (what
was at stake), the **decision** itself, the **alternatives** we
considered and rejected, and the **consequences**.

ADRs are append-only. If a later decision reverses or amends an
earlier one, write a new ADR that supersedes it; do not edit history.
