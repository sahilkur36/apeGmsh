"""OpenSees runtime target + capability resolution.

apeGmsh hands a model to OpenSees over three independent paths, each
binding a *different* runtime:

* **live / in-process** — ``ops.run()`` / ``ops.analyze()`` drive
  ``import openseespy.opensees`` from the active interpreter;
* **Tcl subprocess** — ``ops.tcl(path, run=True)`` shells out to an
  ``OpenSees`` Tcl binary;
* **openseespy subprocess** — ``ops.py(path, run=True)`` shells out to a
  python interpreter that has openseespy installed.

:class:`OpenSeesTarget` is the single, explicit seam that says *which*
runtime each subprocess path binds, and asserts an expectation on the
live path.  Without it, resolution falls back to environment variables
(``$OPENSEES_BIN`` / ``$OPENSEES_VENV``) and ``PATH`` exactly as before
— the target only ever *overrides* that fallback, never removes it.

Fork-ness is **not** a path.  Pointing ``binary=`` at the Ladruno fork
build does not, by itself, tell apeGmsh the build has ``BezierTet10`` —
that stays a capability detected at the point of use (see
:mod:`apeGmsh.opensees.emitter.live`).  ``require_fork`` is the one
place a target carries a fork *expectation*, and it governs only the
**live** path: you cannot swap ``import openseespy`` under a running
interpreter, so ``binary`` / ``python`` are inert for live execution and
``require_fork`` simply fails loud at the ``run()`` / ``analyze()``
boundary instead of three primitives deep.

    binary
        Path to the OpenSees **Tcl** binary used by ``ops.tcl(run=True)``.
        Overrides ``$OPENSEES_BIN`` and ``shutil.which("OpenSees")``.  An

    python
        Path to a **python interpreter with openseespy** used by
        ``ops.py(run=True)``.  Overrides ``$OPENSEES_VENV`` and
        ``shutil.which("python")``.  An explicit ``ops.py(python=...)``

    require_fork
