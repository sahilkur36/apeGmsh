"""
H5Emitter — buffers the bridge's emit calls and writes a model-definition
HDF5 archive conforming to ``architecture/h5-schema.md``.

Unlike the stream emitters (Tcl, Py, Live), this is a **structured**
emitter: each Protocol method updates an in-memory buffer; the file is
materialized at the end via :meth:`write`. The structured shape is
required because the schema groups by name
(``/opensees/materials/uniaxial/{name}``,
``/opensees/sections/{name}``, ...), and aggregate sections / patterns
need open / close bracketing while patches, fibers, loads, and sps
land inside them.

Design notes
============

**Names from tags (Option B in ADR 0011's discussion).** The bridge's
typed primitives carry no user-supplied ``name`` field. Every name in
the file is generated from ``<type_token>_<tag>`` (e.g. ``Steel02_1``,
``Fiber_2``, ``forceBeamColumn_3``). Cross-references resolve via the
generated names. No Protocol extension was required.

**Schema layout.** Phase 8.4 partitioned ``model.h5`` into two zones
(see ``architecture/h5-schema.md`` and
``architecture/phase-8-untangle.md`` §3):

* ``/meta`` and ``/elements`` stay at the file root.  ``/elements``
  sits in the neutral zone because Phase 8.5 hands the writer from
  the bridge to the broker; for now the bridge still emits it.
* Everything else the bridge writes (materials, sections, transforms,
  beam_integration, time_series, patterns, bcs, recorders, analysis)
  lives under ``/opensees/`` so a future second solver can plug in at
  the same level without colliding.

The reshuffle is a breaking schema change — ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` jumps
``1.1.0 → 2.0.0``.  Phase 7a (ADR 0023) replaced the previous
``EXPECTED_SCHEMA_MAJOR`` constant with per-zone two-version-window
validation in :mod:`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.schema_version`.

**Schema deviation (documented).**  One place where the streaming
Protocol cannot supply the spec-level grouping the schema asks for:

* ``/opensees/transforms/{name}`` — the schema shows one group per
  user-declared transform with a ``per_element_vecxz`` dataset of
  shape ``(n_elements, 3)``.  The orientation-driven fan-out in the bridge's
  build layer emits one ``geomTransf`` line per *distinct* vecxz; the
  H5 emitter sees these as N independent calls and cannot
  reverse-engineer the spec boundary.  We therefore emit one
  ``/opensees/transforms/{type}_{tag}/`` group per ``geomTransf``
  call, each carrying a single-row ``per_element_vecxz`` and
  ``per_element_emitted_tag``.  The viewer's vecxz overlay (which
  only needs ``element_id → vecxz``) still works: it iterates all
  transform groups.

**Elements binned by type token (design choice, not deviation).**  The
schema groups elements by element-type token
(``/elements/forceBeamColumn/``, ``/elements/FourNodeTetrahedron/``,
...).  The streaming Protocol does not surface the PG (``spec.pg`` is
known only inside ``_internal/build.py``'s element fan-out), so the
H5 emitter bins by type.  Each group's ``ids`` and ``connectivity``
datasets stack every element of that type across all PGs; the
``args`` / ``args_str`` dataset pair encodes the element's positional
arg list so a vocabulary-aware reader can recover refs.

Both the transform deviation and the elements-by-type choice are
recorded as ``__deviation__`` attrs on the affected groups so a
reader can detect them and degrade gracefully.

**Lazy h5py import.** ``h5py`` is imported only inside :meth:`write` so
constructing an :class:`H5Emitter` (or driving emit) does not pull
the dependency into import time for users who never call ``ops.h5()``.

#: Schema version string emitted in ``/meta/schema_version``. Bump
#: ``MAJOR`` only on a breaking change; ``MINOR`` for additive groups
#: (such as the ``/beam_integration`` group introduced alongside the
#: Protocol's ``beamIntegration`` method in Phase 4.5).
#:
#: History:
#:   * 1.0.0 — Phase 6 initial release.
#:   * 1.1.0 — added ``/beam_integration`` group + widened fiber-layer
#:     ``line`` field from float[4] to float[6].
#:   * 2.0.0 — Phase 8.4: bridge-written groups (materials, sections,
#:     transforms, beam_integration, time_series, patterns, bcs,
#:     recorders, analysis) moved under ``/opensees/``.  ``/meta`` and
#:     ``/elements`` stay at root.
#:   * 2.1.0 — Phase 8.5: broker-side neutral zone added (``/nodes``,
#:     ``/elements/{type}``, ``/physical_groups``, ``/labels``,
#:     ``/constraints/{kind}``, ``/loads/{kind}/{pattern}``,
#:     ``/masses``).  ``/elements`` writing handed from bridge to
#:     broker; the bridge no longer emits this group.  Additive — old
#:     v2.0.0 readers still work, they just don't see the new groups.
#:   * 2.2.0 — Phase 8.6: ``fem_eids`` int64 dataset added under each
#:     ``/opensees/element_meta/{type_token}/`` group, parallel to
#:     ``ids``.  Carries the FEM element id each OpenSees tag was
#:     fanned out from (master plan §3 "tag_map").  Sentinel ``-1``
#:     entries mark records emitted outside a bridge fan-out.
#:     Additive — old v2.1.0 readers ignore the new dataset.
#:   * 2.3.0 — Phase 9 commit 6: unified ``/opensees/recorders/``
#:     archive.  Every record group gains a ``kind`` attr —
#:     ``"typed"`` for Node / Element / MPCO primitives (1:1
#:     OpenSees), ``"declared"`` for fan-out calls produced by
#:     ``ops.recorder.declare(...)``. Declared records also carry
#:     the original declaration metadata as attrs:
#:     ``declaration_name``, ``record_name``, ``category``,
#:     ``components``, ``raw``, ``pg``, ``label``, ``selection``,
#:     ``ids``, ``dt``, ``n_steps``, ``file_root``.  Additive — old
#:     v2.2.0 readers see ``kind="declared"`` records as well-formed
#:     recorder groups (they just ignore the extra attrs).
#:   * 2.4.0 — Phase 8.7 commit 2: ``/mesh_selections/`` neutral-zone
#:     group added, mirroring ``/physical_groups`` / ``/labels`` shape.
#:     Carries post-mesh selection sets (``g.mesh_selection`` →
#:     ``fem.mesh_selection``) so the viewer's ``selection=`` selector
#:     round-trips through ``model.h5``.  Additive — old v2.3.0 readers
#:     ignore the new group and lose only the ``selection=`` round-trip
#:     convenience (live mesh_viewer sessions still consult the live
#:     ``fem.mesh_selection`` directly).
#:   * 2.5.0 — apeGmsh.cuts v4: ``/opensees/cuts/`` and
#:     ``/opensees/sweeps/`` groups added for SectionCutDef and
#:     SectionSweepDef persistence (writer lives in
#:     :mod:`apeGmsh.cuts._h5_io`).  Additive — pre-v4 readers ignore
#:     the new groups.
#:   * 2.6.0 — Phase 6 (ADR 0021): the ``/meta/lineage/`` sub-group
#:     is stamped alongside the bridge zone by
#:     :func:`_compose_model_h5`.  Additive — the lineage attrs are
#:     readable by 2.5.x consumers as opaque extra meta children
#:     (the bridge reader ignores them; the read side surfaces a
#:     "lineage absent" warning when the sub-group is missing on a
#:     legacy file).  Per ADR 0023 two-version reader window, both
#:     2.5.x and 2.6.x files are accepted.
#:   * 2.7.0 — Phase 7b (ADR 0022): MP constraint emission fanout.
#:     The H5 emitter gained the ``/opensees/constraints/`` group
#:     with four compound-dtype datasets — ``equalDOF``,
#:     ``rigidLink``, ``rigidDiaphragm``, ``embeddedNode`` — one
#:     row per :meth:`equalDOF` / :meth:`rigidLink` /
#:     :meth:`rigidDiaphragm` / :meth:`embeddedNode` call.  Each
#:     dataset carries the constraint's ``name`` field (declaration
#:     label round-trip, INV-2) and a ``phantom_node_tags`` int64
#:     dataset records phantom-node tags written via
#:     :meth:`node` with ``ndf=6`` so a reader can identify which
#:     nodes were synthesized by the phantom-emit pre-step (INV-3).
#:     Additive — old 2.6.x readers ignore the new group.  Per ADR
#:     0023 two-version reader window, both 2.6.x and 2.7.x files
#:     are accepted.
#:   * 2.8.0 — embeddedNode field rename: the second compound-dtype
#:     column of ``/opensees/constraints/embeddedNode`` was
#:     ``embedding_ele`` in 2.7.0 (a misnomer — the value is the
#:     constrained / slave node id, not an element id) and is
#:     ``cnode`` from 2.8.0 onward (matches the OpenSees ``$Cnode``
#:     vocabulary).  Stored values are unchanged; only the column
#:     name flips.  No in-repo reader consumed the 2.7.0 name, so
#:     no compat shim is required; the two-version reader window
#:     accepts 2.7.x and 2.8.x files but the column name is
#:     version-dependent.
#:   * 2.9.0 — ADR 0024 (Emitter Protocol widening for ``region()``):
#:     the H5 emitter gained the ``/opensees/regions/`` group, with
#:     one ``region_NNN`` sub-group per :meth:`region` call carrying
#:     the integer ``tag`` attribute plus a ``params`` dataset
#:     mirroring the OpenSees flag tail (``-node n1 n2 ...``,
#:     ``-ele e1 e2 ...``, etc.).  Auto-emitted today by the
#:     ``MPCO`` recorder fan-out (``nodes_pg=`` / ``elements_pg=``)
#:     so MPCO output filtered by ``-R $tag`` round-trips through
#:     ``OpenSeesModel.from_h5(...).build("tcl", ...)``.  Additive —
#:     old 2.8.x readers ignore the new group and lose only the
#:     filter round-trip (the MPCO recorder line still carries the
#:     dangling ``-R`` reference; the bridge raises if the
#:     referenced region is missing at re-emit time).  Per ADR 0023
#:     two-version reader window, both 2.8.x and 2.9.x files are
#:     accepted.
#:   * 2.10.0 — ADR 0027 (cross-partition MP-constraint emission policy):
#:     the H5 emitter gained the ``/opensees/partitions/`` group plus
#:     a parallel ``partition_ids`` int64 column on every
#:     ``/opensees/element_meta/{type_token}/`` group.  The new
#:     :meth:`partition_open` / :meth:`partition_close` Protocol
#:     methods bracket per-rank emit blocks; each block populates one
#:     ``partition_NN`` sub-group with ``element_ids`` /
#:     ``node_ids`` / ``boundary_node_ids`` int64 datasets and
#:     ``rank`` / ``n_elements`` / ``n_nodes`` scalar attrs.  The
#:     parent ``/opensees/partitions/`` group carries the
#:     ``n_partitions`` scalar attr.  Boundary nodes are computed on
#:     write as the per-rank set intersected against every other
#:     rank's node set — symmetric across ranks.  Elements emitted
#:     outside a ``partition_open`` / ``partition_close`` bracket get
#:     ``partition_ids`` row value ``-1``.  Additive — old 2.9.x
#:     readers ignore the new group and the new column.  Per ADR 0023
#:     two-version reader window, both 2.9.x and 2.10.x files are
#:     accepted.
#:   * 2.11.0 — bug fix: the bridge now emits **0-based runtime ranks**
#:     (matching ``OpenSeesMP::getPID()``) instead of Gmsh's 1-based
#:     ``PartitionRecord.id``.  Side effect on this zone: per-partition
#:     group ``rank`` attrs and the parallel ``partition_ids`` column
#:     values become 0-based (``0..N-1``) instead of 1-based (``1..N``).
#:     Group naming (``partition_NN`` is just the loop index) is
#:     unchanged.  The broker's Gmsh-side 1-based ``PartitionRecord.id``
#:     is preserved verbatim (only the runtime-rank seam flipped).
#:     Breaking for any reader that mapped ``rank`` attr / partition_ids
#:     values to ``part.id`` directly; per ADR 0023 two-version reader
#:     window, both 2.10.x and 2.11.x files are accepted.
#:   * 2.12.0 — ADR 0035 (ASDEmbeddedNodeElement option exposure): the
#:     ``/opensees/constraints/embeddedNode`` compound dtype gains five
#:     typed columns — ``stiffness`` (float64, ``-K``),
#:     ``stiffness_p`` (float64, ``-KP``) + ``has_stiffness_p`` (uint8
#:     sentinel for ``None``), ``rotational`` (uint8, ``-rot``),
#:     ``pressure`` (uint8, ``-p``).  Defaults written when the user
#:     leaves the kwargs untouched match the C++ parser at
#:     ``ASDEmbeddedNodeElement.cpp:222`` (K = 1e18, ``has_stiffness_p``
#:     = 0, rot = 0, p = 0), so old decks emitted by the legacy path
#:     observe semantically-identical on-deck behaviour.  Additive —
#:     old 2.11.x readers ignore the new columns.  Per ADR 0023 two-
#:     version reader window, both 2.11.x and 2.12.x files are
#:     accepted.
#:   * 2.13.0 — bridge-side name aliases: a ``/opensees/names`` sidecar
#:     group (``name`` / ``kind`` / ``tag`` datasets) persists the
#:     ``ops.<family>.<Type>(..., name=...)`` aliases so the read side
#:     (``OpenSeesModel`` / ``Results`` / viewer) can resolve a name
#:     back to its kind+tag.  Names are labels, not structure: the
#:     group is in ``MODEL_HASH_EXCLUDED_CHILDREN``, so relabelling
#:     never perturbs ``model_hash`` (same carve-out as cuts / sweeps /
#:     regions).  Written only when at least one name is registered, so
#:     name-free files stay byte-identical to 2.12.x.  Additive — old
#:     2.12.x readers ignore the group.  Per ADR 0023 two-version
#:     reader window, both 2.12.x and 2.13.x files are accepted.
#:   * 2.14.0 — ADR 0048/0049 (PR-2): new optional ``/opensees/nodes_ndf``
#:     group (``tags`` int64 + ``ndf`` int8, aligned to the broker node
#:     order) persisting the *effective* per-node ndf the deck emits
#:     (``fem.nodes.ndf_for`` override else the ``ops.model`` envelope).
#:     The one bridge-owned ndf store that the read-side and ADR 0049
#:     ``ops.ndf`` will write/read through; folds into ``model_hash`` (the
#:     opensees zone walks every dataset), never ``fem_hash``.  Written for
#:     broker-backed files only; absent on bridge-only stubs.  Additive —
#:     old 2.13.x readers ignore it.  Per ADR 0023 two-version reader
#:     window, both 2.13.x and 2.14.x files are accepted.
#:   * 2.15.0 — ADR 0053 (D3b): new ``/opensees/dampings/`` group, one
#:     ``damping_NNN`` sub-group per :meth:`damping` call carrying the
#:     ``type`` token (``Uniform`` / ``SecStif`` / ``URD`` / ``URDbeta``)
#:     + integer ``tag`` attr + a ``params`` dataset mirroring the
#:     OpenSees argument tail.  Closes the D3a gap where ``damping``
#:     objects were lost on a ``model.h5`` round-trip (the method was a
#:     no-op).  Replayed by :func:`_replay_into` after ``time_series``
#:     (a ``-factor`` series dependency resolves first) and before
#:     elements (an element's ``-damp $tag`` rides in its own arg tail),
#:     so element-attached damping survives ``from_h5 → build``.  These
#:     are authored model state, so the group **folds into**
#:     ``model_hash`` (unlike the regenerable regions/names carve-outs).
#:     Region-based ``-damp`` / ``-rayleigh`` attachments share the
#:     pre-existing ``/opensees/regions`` limitation (archival, not
#:     re-emitted).  Additive group, but the version bump is a producer
#:     **hard floor** (see 2.16.0 below for the corrected window
#:     semantics): a 2.14.x reader REFUSES a 2.15.x file
#:     (``file.minor > reader.minor`` → ``SchemaVersionError``,
#:     :func:`schema_version.validate_zone_version`).  The window only
#:     lets a *newer* reader open an *older* file, never the reverse —
#:     the earlier "old readers ignore the new group" phrasing in these
#:     bullets is inaccurate and is corrected from 2.16.0 onward.
#:   * 2.16.0 — ADR 0055 Phase 1 (global initial-stress archival): new
#:     ``/opensees/initial_stress`` group, one ``stress_NNN`` sub-group
#:     per global ``ops.initial_stress(...)`` record carrying the
#:     declarative field set (``name`` + ``sigma_xx/yy/zz`` +
#:     ``ramp_steps`` + ``lambda_install`` attrs, and EITHER a ``pg``
#:     attr XOR an ``elements`` int64 dataset).  Pre-resolve / declarative
#:     (no parameter tags, no rendered ramp proc): replay re-runs
#:     :func:`emit_initial_stress_global` /
#:     :func:`emit_initial_stress_addtoparameter` to regenerate the
#:     deck byte-identically.  Closes the global-bucket half of the
#:     ``apeSees.h5`` fail-loud guard (the staged bucket stays loud).
#:     Authored model state → **folds into** ``model_hash``.  Written
#:     only when at least one global initial-stress record exists, so
#:     vanilla files stay byte-identical to 2.15.x.
#:     **Window semantics (hard floor, applies to every bump):** once
#:     the writer stamps 2.16.0, every file it writes — vanilla included
#:     — is 2.16.0, and a still-deployed 2.15.0 reader REFUSES it
#:     (newer-minor branch of
#:     :func:`schema_version.validate_zone_version`).  All readers must
#:     be ≥ 2.16.0 to open any file written after this lands; the window
#:     only buys a 2.16 reader the ability to open 2.15 files, NOT the
#:     reverse.
#:   * 2.17.0 — ADR 0049 (node-pair zeroLength): new optional
#:     ``inline_connectivity`` vlen-int64 dataset under
#:     ``/opensees/element_meta/{type}/`` carrying the endpoint node tags
#:     of node-pair elements (``ops.element.ZeroLength(nodes=...)`` etc.),
#:     which have no backing gmsh cell in the neutral ``/elements`` zone
#:     and so cannot source their connectivity from there on re-emit.
#:     Written only when a type group has ≥1 node-pair (``fem_eid < 0``)
#:     row, so PG-only models are byte-identical and their ``model_hash``
#:     is unchanged.  Folds into ``model_hash`` (connectivity is
#:     model-defining).  Additive group; the hard-floor window semantics
#:     above apply (a 2.16.x reader REFUSES a 2.17.x file; a 2.17 reader
#:     opens 2.16 and 2.17 files).

    * ``{key}_str`` — UTF-8 vlen string array, empty string in slots
      that hold a numeric value. Written ONLY if at least one slot is
      a string (pure-numeric param lists skip ``{key}_str`` entirely).

    Slot ``i`` of the original ``*args`` is reconstructible by reading
    whichever of the two arrays has a non-sentinel value.

        Public schema-owning method used by

        ``vecxz`` orientation the viewer's beam join needs
        (``h5_reader.element_local_axes_vecxz``).  Driving the bridge
        Protocol methods (``geomTransf`` / ``element``) from a
        declarative front-door would require pre-setting ``_internal``
        side-channels — exporting bridge-internal coupling into a
        public class.  This method appends a ``_TransformRecord`` and
        per-element ``_ElementRecord`` instances directly, stamping a
        real positive ``fem_eid`` (ADR 0018 INV-6).

        Tag values are file-internal — ``model.h5`` only needs the
        transf record's ``tag`` to match the value stored at the
        registry-defined slot of each element's ``args``.  The reader
        join (h5_reader.py:336-363) never cross-checks against a live
        OpenSees domain.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type_token
            OpenSees element type (``"forceBeamColumn"``,
            ``"elasticBeamColumn"``, ...).  Must yield a transf slot
            via :func:`_transf_arg_tail_index` for ``ndm``; an unknown
            token or one with no transf slot raises (ADR 0018 INV-7).
        vecxz
            Three-tuple ``(vx, vy, vz)``.
        elements
            Iterable of ``(fem_eid, connectivity)`` pairs.  ``fem_eid``
            must be ``> 0`` — sentinel ``-1`` is invalid for a
            declarative inject (ADR 0018 INV-6).
        ndm
            2 or 3.  Selects ``slots_2d`` vs ``slots_3d`` for the
            transf-tag positional slot (ADR 0018 INV-9).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``ndm`` is not in ``{2, 3}``, ``vecxz`` lacks 3
            components, ``type_token`` is unknown / has no transf
