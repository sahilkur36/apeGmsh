"""
TclEmitter — accumulates a Tcl deck as a list of strings.

The Tcl emitter is a pure text builder. Every Protocol method appends
one (or, for block-emit primitives, a few) lines to ``_lines``. The
deck is retrieved via :meth:`lines` once :meth:`emit` has driven the
full BuiltModel.

Tcl-specific dialect choices:

* Sections that take blocks (``Fiber``) emit
  ``section Fiber 1 -GJ 1.0e9 \\{`` with the opening brace; subsequent
  ``patch`` / ``fiber`` / ``layer`` lines indent inside the block;
  ``section_close`` emits ``\\}``.

* ``pattern_open`` is dispatched on the type token: ``Plain`` and
  ``MultiSupport`` open a block (``pattern Plain 1 1 \\{``); single-line
  patterns like ``UniformExcitation`` emit a single line and
  ``pattern_close`` is a no-op.

* Floats render with Python's ``repr(float)`` precision — enough digits
  to round-trip through the parser without rewriting the user's
  numbers.

    ``append(line)`` prepends ``indent`` to ``line`` before storing.
    This keeps the existing ``self._lines.append(...)`` call sites in
    :class:`TclEmitter` working unchanged while
    ``partition_open(K)`` / ``partition_close()`` toggle the indent.

    **Dual mode** (ADR 0065 Tier 2 / plan_emit_memory_columnar.md

    nothing — the buffer stays empty and peak emit memory stops
    scaling with deck size. The partition-indent logic is unchanged
    (it lives here in ``append``), so all emitter call sites are
    captured for free. In stream mode, ``insert`` (the ``preamble()``
    front-insert) fails loud — earlier lines are already on disk.
