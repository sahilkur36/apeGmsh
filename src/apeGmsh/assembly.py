"""``Assembly`` — declarative spatial model-coupling graph (ADR 0043 slice 1.4).

The :class:`Assembly` is the user-facing "Workbench" object the
connectivity-graph initiative is building toward: declare several saved
apeGmsh models (``model.h5``) as **parts**, join them with interface
**couples** (constraints), then :meth:`~Assembly.materialize` the whole
graph into one composed session in a single pass.

``Assembly`` is imported from this sub-module, **not** the top-level
package (``from apeGmsh.assembly import Assembly``). The v1.0 API
deliberately removed an earlier ``Assembly`` class and guards against a
top-level export — "the session IS the assembly" (see
``tests/test_library_contracts.py`` + the ADR 0043 "v1.0 Assembly
removal" note). This declarative builder is sugar that *produces* a
session, so it earns a sub-path home now; the top-level name is reserved
until the graph / scheduler layer (slice 1.5+) exists and ADR 0043 is
accepted.

    from apeGmsh.assembly import Assembly

    asm = Assembly("cerro_lindo")
    asm.add("pier", "pier.h5")                 # first add = host
    asm.add("soil", "soil.h5", translate=(0.0, 0.0, -5.0))
    asm.couple(
        "soil", "pier", kind="tied_contact",
        ports=("top", "base"), dofs=[1, 2, 3],
    )
    g = asm.materialize()                      # -> composed apeGmsh session
    g.save("cerro_lindo.h5")                   # or apeSees(g._fem).tcl(...)

Design (ADR 0043 mode A; settled via the slice-1.4 red/blue pass):

* **Thin wrapper.** ``add`` resolves to :meth:`apeGmsh.from_h5` (first
  part = host) + :meth:`apeGmsh.compose` (each later part, namespaced
  under its label); ``couple`` resolves to ``g.constraints.<kind>(...)``
  routed through the chain-phase resolver (ADR 0041). No new emit / merge
  machinery — the pipeline was verified end-to-end before this landed.
* **Host asymmetry is handled.** ``g.compose`` leaves the host's physical
  groups *un-namespaced* and prefixes every later part's groups with its
  label. So a ``port`` on the host part resolves to the bare PG name; a
  ``port`` on a composed part resolves to ``"{label}.{pg}"``. The caller
  always writes bare per-part PG names; :meth:`materialize` does the
  namespacing.
* **Fail loud.** The chain-phase router silently no-ops a constraint whose
  target name does not resolve (it swallows ``KeyError`` for build-phase
  back-compat). :meth:`materialize` detects a couple that produced no
  constraint record and raises :class:`AssemblyError` — a declared
  interface that ties nothing is a setup bug, never a silent empty deck.
* **Declarative / lazy.** ``add`` and ``couple`` only record; all I/O and
  resolution happen in :meth:`materialize`.

Out of scope for slice 1.4 (deferred to 1.5): ``Assembly.emit`` (the
split-deck export — use ``apeSees(g._fem).tcl(split=True)`` on the
materialised session) and ``Assembly.graph`` (inspection). ``couple``
supports ``kind="equal_dof"`` and ``kind="tied_contact"``; ``embedded``
needs host-volume geometry the bare-PG ports model does not express and
is deferred.
