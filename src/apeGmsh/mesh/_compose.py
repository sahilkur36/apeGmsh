"""apeGmsh.mesh._compose — Compose facade scaffold (Phase 3B.1 / ADR 0038).

The :class:`Compose` facade is a session-level entry point that lands the
shell of ADR 0038's ``g.compose(...)`` API: input validation, the
``compose_inspect`` / ``compose_list`` companion helpers, the
:class:`ComposedModule` handle, and the typed exception hierarchy.

The merge engine itself — tag-offset reservation, namespace prefix
sweep, record rewrite + verifier — is intentionally **deferred** to
Phase 3B.2.  Calling :meth:`Compose.compose` here raises
:class:`NotImplementedError` after the input gates pass; ``inspect`` and
``list`` are fully functional because they only read H5 metadata or walk
the current broker's ``fem.composed_from``.

# Nested composition — depth tracking + separator alternation (Phase 3E.1)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ADR 0038 §"Nested composition" — three coupled rules for composing
# a source that is itself a composed assembly:
#
#   1. Depth limit: ``source_depth >= max_compose_depth`` raises
#      :class:`ComposeDepthExceededError`.  Default ``max_compose_depth = 3``.
#   2. Separator alternation: at depth N the outer namespace separator
#      flips ``.`` ↔ ``/`` so depth boundaries stay parseable.  Convention:
#      depth 1 = ``.``, depth 2 = ``/``, depth 3 = ``.``, ... (odd = ``.``,
#      even = ``/``).
#   3. Provenance graft: source's existing ``composed_from`` records get
#      their labels re-prefixed with the outer label (using the depth-N
#      separator) and surface in the host's flat ``composed_from`` chain.

#: Default cap on nested-compose depth per ADR 0038 §"Nested composition".
#: Class constant on :class:`Compose`; the public ``compose(...)`` method
#: also accepts ``max_compose_depth=N`` as a per-call override.
DEFAULT_MAX_COMPOSE_DEPTH: int = 3

#: Advisory threshold on a compose's interface size per ADR 0038
#: §"v1 scope gate" (Phase 3F.1).  The Phase 1 microbenchmark passed
#: at 10k x 4 ranks but breached emit / parse / RSS thresholds at
#: 100k x 8 ranks; the middle-branch decision was to ship compose at
#: full scope and emit a :class:`ComposeInterfaceSizeWarning` when the
#: caller's compose lands in the regime where downstream cross-rank
#: emit / parse cost may become a problem.
#:
#: "Interface size" here is the count of MP-style constraint records
#: in the rewritten bundle (node-side + element-side) — each replicates
#: across ranks per ADR 0027's cross-partition emission rules, so the
#: replication cost scales with the constraint count regardless of
#: rank count.  Constants in :data:`apeGmsh.mesh._compose` rather than
#: a sub-config because the threshold is a property of the Phase 1
#: gate, not user configuration.

        properties : dict | None
            Free-form provenance dict round-tripped through

            ``g.save()``.
        max_compose_depth : int or None, default None
            Per-call override of the class-level
            :data:`MAX_COMPOSE_DEPTH` (default 3).  Raises
            :class:`ComposeDepthExceededError` when the source's own
            ``composed_from`` depth would push the result past the
            cap.  ``None`` falls back to the class-level default; pass
            an explicit integer to lift the cap for a single compose
            call.  See ADR 0038 §"Nested composition" (Phase 3E.1).
        compose_size_per_module : int | None
            Explicit reservation-size floor per ADR 0038 §"Tag-offset
            scheme".  ``None`` means "auto-size from the source's
            actual span".  Phase 3B.2 honours the override; 3B.1
            validates only ``> 0``.

        Raises
        ------
        ComposeLabelError
            ``label=`` violates the lexical rules.
        ComposeAnchorError
            ``anchor=`` combined with a non-zero ``translate=``.
        ValueError
            ``partition_rank < 0`` or ``compose_size_per_module <= 0``.
        NotImplementedError
            Always, after validation, until Phase 3B.2 wires the merge
            engine.

def _rebuild_partitions_from_modules(fem: "FEMData") -> "FEMData":
    """Phase 3B.2d / ADR 0038 §"Rank model" — eager populator.

    Walks the host's :attr:`fem.composed_from` chain and writes a
    ``module_label → partition_rank`` map onto the host's node /
    element ``_partitions`` back-stores so the broker reports the
    composed modules as separate partitions.

    Three layers of rank assignment (ADR 0038 §"Rank model"):

    * **Layer 1 (default)** — auto-assign one rank per module in
      compose order: host nodes/elements land on rank 0, the
      first composed module on rank 1, the second on rank 2, etc.
      Activated when every ``ComposeRecord.partition_rank`` is
      ``None``.
    * **Layer 2 (hint)** — when one or more modules carry an
      explicit ``partition_rank=K`` hint on their ``ComposeRecord``,
      those ranks override the Layer-1 default for that module.
      Other modules get auto-assigned around the hints to avoid
      collisions (sequential lowest-unused integer).
    * **Layer 3 (METIS override)** — when the user later runs
      partition refinement that overrides module ranks, the caller
      is responsible for emitting a :class:`UserWarning` noting the
      override.  This populator emits the warning itself when it
      detects that ``fem`` already carries explicit per-node /
      per-element partition assignments AND a Layer-1/2 module map
      would disagree.

    Pure-ish helper: ``fem`` is not deep-copied — the partition
    back-stores are replaced in place on the existing composite
    instances + a new :class:`PartitionSet` is built on the result.
    Returns a new :class:`FEMData` carrying the rebuilt partitions
    so callers can chain transforms.

    Phase 3F.1 / ADR 0038 §"v1 scope gate".  The gate matrix

    emit / parse cost as a function of an ``interface_size`` parameter
    that counts the embedded interpolation constraints in the
    fixture.  At compose time the same quantity is the count of
    constraint records carried by the rewritten bundle — each of
    those records will, at emit time, fan out across ranks per
    ADR 0027's cross-partition emission rules (``equalDOF``,
    ``rigidLink``, ``rigidDiaphragm``, ``embeddedNode``,
    ``mp_constraint_comment``), so the cost scales with the
    constraint count regardless of rank count.

    Counts the node-side + element-side constraint streams on the
    bundle.  Other interface-class proxies (interface node count, PG
    member counts) are correlated but indirect; the constraint count
    matches the gate fixture's framing exactly.
