"""Mass records — post-mesh resolved nodal masses.

The :class:`MassRecord` dataclass carries the per-node 6-DOF mass
vector produced by :class:`~apeGmsh.mesh._mass_resolver.MassResolver`
after meshing.  Records are solver-agnostic — any adapter (OpenSees,
Abaqus, Code_Aster, …) can consume them.

The corresponding pre-mesh :class:`MassDef` definitions live in
:mod:`apeGmsh.core.masses.defs`.
