"""LiveMPCO — in-process STKO MPCO recorder emission.

Issues a single ``ops.recorder("mpco", path, -N ..., -E ..., -T ...)``
call into the running openseespy domain on ``__enter__`` and removes
it on ``__exit__`` (which is what flushes the HDF5 file). The MPCO
recorder writes one file containing all stages — there is no
``begin_stage``/``end_stage`` ceremony, since pseudoTime in the
OpenSees domain handles stage scoping internally.

Build-gate
----------
Vanilla ``openseespy`` distributions do **not** include the MPCO
recorder. STKO ships its own openseespy build that does. If the
recorder is unavailable, ``__enter__`` raises with a pointer to the
two workable options (STKO's distribution, or ``spec.emit_recorders``
on the classic recorder path).

Usage
-----
::

    from apeGmsh.opensees.recorder import Recorders
    recorders = Recorders(opensees=ops)
    recorders.nodes(components=["displacement"])

        for _ in range(n_steps):
            ops.analyze(1, dt)

    Parameters
    ----------
    spec
        The :class:`ResolvedRecorderSpec` whose records to emit.
    path
        Output ``.mpco`` HDF5 file path. Parent directory created on

    ops
        The openseespy module (or a stand-in for testing). Defaults

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        On ``__enter__`` if ``ops.recorder('mpco', ...)`` fails — most
        commonly because the openseespy build does not include the
        MPCO recorder.
