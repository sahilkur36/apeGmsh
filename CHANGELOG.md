## v1.5.0 — Applied loads + reactions diagrams · geometry-scoped gate

One PR landing on top of v1.4.0's post-release work. The
ResultsViewer gains two new diagram kinds in the Add layer dropdown
— **Applied loads** (constant force arrows, one diagram per load
pattern) and **Reactions** (recorded reaction forces and moments,
auto-scaling per step with the time slider). The composition gate
is also tightened so adding a brand-new Geometry no longer leaves
the previous Geometry's diagrams visible.

PR in this release: [#92].

### ADDED — Applied loads diagram ([#92])

`Add layer → Applied loads` lists every `fem.nodes.loads` pattern
that carries at least one non-zero force record. Each diagram
renders force arrows at the resolved nodes for one pattern. Reference
magnitudes only — the broker does not carry the OpenSees
`timeSeries` function, so step scaling is intentionally deferred
(the diagram's `update_to_step` is a documented no-op until
timeSeries metadata lands in the broker). Moments are not drawn
yet; they need a different glyph and will follow.

### ADDED — Reactions diagram ([#92])

`Add layer → Reactions` (enabled iff the file has any
`reaction_force_*` or `reaction_moment_*` recordings). Forces render
as straight arrows; moments use the existing `moment_glyph` curved
arrow. Each family auto-fits its own scale because forces and
torques have different units. The diagram is step-resolved — every
time-slider move re-reads the slab and rebuilds the glyphs. An
auto-filter drops nodes whose magnitude max-over-time is below
`zero_tol × global_max`, so free-interior nodes don't pollute the
scene with near-zero arrows.

### FIXED — Composition gate scoped to active Geometry ([#92])

The gate previously hid layers using the flat diagram registry, so
adding a new (empty) Geometry kept the previous Geometry's diagrams
visible — `active_comp is None` set `show_all=True` and turned every
actor on regardless of which Geometry owned it. The visible-layer
set is now restricted to compositions of the active Geometry; an
empty Geometry shows nothing, an existing one with no active
composition still shows its own layers (preserving the prior
single-Geometry "show all" intent within the active Geometry).

## v1.4.0 — ResultsViewer dock split · new-layer attach + lifecycle fixes · import banner

Six PRs landing on top of v1.3.0. The post-solve viewer's right rail
splits into dedicated **Diagram** and **Geometry** docks (tabified
with Details and Session), with a new floating "?" shortcut HUD on
the viewport. New-layer attach now pushes the active step + re-fires
deformation sync so freshly-added line-force / vector-glyph layers
land aligned with the rest of the scene instead of paint-then-drift.
A series of selection-related composition-gate fixes (Esc, outline
Geometry-row click, stale session restore) stop diagrams from
silently disappearing when the user navigates the outline. The HDF5
reader is now released on viewer close, so re-running a capture
script in the same kernel no longer hits `PermissionError`. The
package prints an ASCII banner + `__version__` on import (suppress
with `APEGMSH_QUIET=1`) so the running version is unambiguous.

PRs in this release: [#69], [#70], [#71], [#72], [#73], [#74].

### ADDED — Diagram / Geometry dock split ([#69])

The right rail's single Details dock — which previously stacked the
DiagramSettingsTab and GeometrySettingsPanel inside a QStackedWidget
— is split into two dedicated docks:

- **Diagram** dock hosts `DiagramSettingsTab.widget` directly.
- **Geometry** dock hosts `GeometrySettingsPanel.widget` directly.
- **Details** dock is reserved for future canvas-driven contextual
  content (contour scalebar edits, picked-node readouts).
- Outline routing: clicking a Composition row raises the Diagram
  dock; clicking a Geometry row raises the Geometry dock.
- The "+ Add layer" button is now on the Diagram dock's title row.
- Layout schema bumped to v5 — saved v4 layouts are discarded so
  users land in the new arrangement on first launch.

### ADDED — Floating shortcut help HUD ([#69])

`ShortcutHelpHUD` — small "?" button in the viewport's bottom-right
corner. Click pops a list of mapped keyboard shortcuts (Esc, Ctrl+H,
Q, N/E/G, Shift+LMB, Shift+click, F2).

### ADDED — Banner + `__version__` on import ([#73])

`import apeGmsh` prints the ASCII banner + the installed version to
stderr. `__version__` is now exposed at the package root, sourced
from `importlib.metadata` (single source of truth = `pyproject.toml`).
Set `APEGMSH_QUIET=1` to suppress for tests / CI / piped scripts.

### FIXED — New-layer attach ([#69])

After `registry.add(...)`, the director now pushes the active step
to the new layer and re-fires `_apply_deformation`. Resolves:

- Line-force diagrams that rendered as collapsed slivers because
  step-0 internal forces are zero (the polydata was correct, the
  values were wrong).
- Vector glyphs that landed at undeformed positions until the user
  manually scrubbed the time slider.

### FIXED — HDF5 reader released on viewer close ([#70])

`ResultsViewer._on_close` now calls `self._results.close()` so the
NativeReader's file handle is released. Re-running a capture script
in the same Jupyter kernel — which deletes and recreates the same
`.h5` path — no longer hits `PermissionError: [WinError 32] The
process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
process`.

### FIXED — Composition gate no longer silently hides diagrams ([#71], [#72], [#74])

Three trigger paths surfaced the same symptom — layers visible in
the dock with checkboxes still checked, but nothing painting in the
viewport — because the composition gate hides every actor when no
composition is "active":

- **#71**: Esc previously called `compositions.set_active(None)`,
  which fired the gate. Esc now only clears probe markers + element
  / GP highlights and leaves composition state alone.
- **#72**: Clicking a Geometry row in the outline previously called
  `compositions.set_active(None)` for the same reason. Selecting a
  Geometry row is now a navigation gesture; composition state is
  left unchanged.
- **#74**: The session JSON persists `active_composition_id`. Pre-#71
  / pre-#72 sessions easily saved `null`. On restore, the gate then
  hid every layer until the user clicked a Composition row. Two-part
  fix: heal stale sessions by defaulting to the first composition
  when the saved active id is null; relax the gate to "show all"
  when no composition is active anywhere.

## v1.3.0 — ResultsViewer B++ redesign · live recorder + MPCO emission · spatial filters

Nine PRs landing on top of v1.2.0. The ResultsViewer ships a full B++
redesign — outline tree, plot pane, viewport HUDs (probe palette top-
right, pick-readout top-left), inline kind picker, style presets,
density toggle — replacing the right-dock tab strip. The recorder
spec gains two new in-process execution strategies (`emit_recorders`
and `emit_mpco`), so one declarative spec now drives five backend
paths. The read side picks up `nearest_to` / `in_box` / `in_sphere` /
`on_plane` spatial filters plus an `element_type=` selector, all
composing additively with the existing `pg=` / `label=` /
`selection=` / `ids=` vocabulary. Elastic beams (`ElasticBeam{2d,3d}`,
`ElasticTimoshenkoBeam{2d,3d}`, `ModElasticBeam2d`) gain a synthesised
2-station line-stations slab via the live capture path, matching the
existing MPCO behaviour. Documentation gets a 6-card landing, grouped
navigation, an 8-notebook curated examples gallery rendered inline
via mkdocs-jupyter, a Recorder reference page, and a Reading &
filtering results guide. **All 9 PRs merged green.**

PRs in this release: [#43], [#44], [#46], [#47], [#48], [#50], [#51],
[#52], [#49].

### ADDED — ResultsViewer B++ redesign ([#43], [#46])

Closes the [B++ Implementation Guide](architecture/apeGmsh_results_viewer.md).
The right-dock tab strip (Stages / Diagrams / Settings / Inspector /
Probes) is retired in favour of a 3×3 grid layout: title-bar row
(40 px), three-column body (left rail · viewport · right rail),
scrubber row (84 px).

- **`ResultsWindow` shell** ([#43] B0). Wraps `ViewerWindow` with the
  3×3 grid central widget. Hidden left (260 px) and right (380 px)
  columns reserve space for the upcoming widgets.
- **`OutlineTree`** ([#43] B1). Left-rail single navigator with four
  groups: Stages, Diagrams, Probes, Plots. Replaces the StagesTab and
  DiagramsTab. Visibility checkboxes toggle render; clicks drive the
  details panel.
- **`PlotPane` + `DetailsPanel`** ([#43] B2). Right-rail vertical-list
  tabs (dot · label · ×). Re-homes the fiber-section, layer-
  thickness, and time-history panels that previously floated as
  `QDockWidget`s on the main-window edges. The DetailsPanel below
  hosts contextual content (DiagramSettingsTab when a diagram row is
  selected).
- **`ProbePaletteHUD`** ([#43] B3). Floating panel in the viewport's
  top-right corner with three mode buttons (Point / Line / Slice) +
  Stop / Clear. Repositions on viewport resize via a Qt event filter.
  Retires `ProbesTab`.
- **`PickReadoutHUD`** ([#46]). Floating glass card in the viewport's
  top-left corner. Subscribes to `ProbeOverlay.on_point_result` and
  Director step / stage changes; renders the picked node id, snapped
  coords, and one mono-typed line per active component value.
  Retires `InspectorTab`.
- **Shift-click → time-history plot** ([#46]). `ShiftClickPicker`
  registers a low-priority VTK observer on `LeftButtonPressEvent`
  that fires only when shift is held; opens (or focuses) a
  `TimeHistoryPanel` as a closable plot-pane tab. The default
  component prefers the active diagram's selector.
- **Title-bar utility strip** ([#46]). Three decorative stop-light
  dots, breadcrumb label, right-aligned icon strip with theme cycle,
  clipboard screenshot, density toggle, help dialog. Theme cycles
  through every palette in `PALETTES`.
- **Density toggle** ([#46]). New `DensityManager` singleton mirroring
  `ThemeManager`. Persists via `QSettings`. `DensityTokens` carry
  `row_h`, `pad_x`, `pad_y`, `gap`, `fs_body`, `fs_head`. The
  global stylesheet picks them up; toggling triggers a full restyle.
- **Two-way tree ↔ plot-tab binding** ([#46]). The Plots group in
  the outline tree mirrors the plot-pane tab list; clicking a Plots
  row activates the matching tab. Empty Plots group falls back to a
  hint placeholder.
- **Inline 2×4 kind picker** ([#46]). Clicking the outline tree's
  "+ Insert" button reveals a 2×4 grid of diagram-kind shortcuts
  directly under the header. Selecting a kind opens
  `AddDiagramDialog` pre-selected for that kind.
- **Diagram picker pre-flight** ([#46]). The Add Diagram dialog now
  greys out kinds whose topology has no data anywhere in the
  Results file (`— no data` suffix). The Component combo
  placeholder distinguishes "no data in file" from "no data in
  selected stage".
- **Style presets** ([#46]). New module
  [`viewers/diagrams/_style_presets.py`] with `style_to_dict` /
  `style_from_dict` codec, `KIND_TO_STYLE_CLASS` registry, and a
  `StylePresetStore` (CRUD under `<QSettings AppConfigLocation>/
  apeGmsh/style_presets/`). Add Diagram dialog gains a Preset combo;
  `DiagramSettingsTab` gains a Save…/Apply footer. Path-traversal
  sanitiser refuses unsafe names.
- **Theme + global-preferences reachability** ([#46]). The
  ResultsWindow help dialog promotes from `QMessageBox` to a proper
  `QDialog` with footer buttons that open the Theme editor and
  Global preferences dialogs (the dock-strip path the other viewers
  use is gone in B5).
- **Theme integration for the new shell** ([#43] B4). Hardcoded
  inline stylesheets removed; the global `build_stylesheet` picks
  up object-name selectors for every new widget (`#ResultsTitleBar`,
  `#OutlineHeader`, `#PlotPaneHeader`, `#DetailsPanel`, `#ProbeHUD`,
  `#OutlineKindPicker`, `#OutlineKindBtn`, etc.). All four palettes
  (catppuccin_mocha, neutral_studio, catppuccin_latte, paper) render
  cleanly.

### ADDED — Live recorder + MPCO emission strategies ([#48])

Two new in-process consumers on the recorder spec — same seam, two
new code paths:

- **`spec.emit_recorders(out_dir)`** — classic recorders pushed live
  into the `ops` domain via `ops.recorder()` calls, with
  `begin_stage` / `end_stage` scoping and per-stage filename
  prefixes (`<stage>__<record>_<token>`).
- **`spec.emit_mpco(path)`** — single in-process MPCO recorder with
  a build-gate that raises with a clear remediation pointer when the
  active openseespy build doesn't include MPCO.
- Threads `stage_id` through emit → cache → transcoder →
  `from_recorders` (default `None` preserves byte-for-byte
  `export.tcl/py` compatibility).
- `to_ops_args` / `mpco_ops_args` are the live-emit equivalents of
  `format_python` / `emit_mpco_python`. Both flow through the
  existing `LogicalRecorder` dataclass so source-form and
  tuple-form share one source of truth.
- Architecture doc rewritten:
  [`apeGmsh_results_obtaining.md`](architecture/apeGmsh_results_obtaining.md)
  covers the spec-as-seam pattern with the five-strategy
  comparison table.
- New user-facing guide:
  [`guide_obtaining_results.md`](internal_docs/guide_obtaining_results.md)
  with worked recipes per strategy + decision flowchart + pitfalls.
- 46 new tests; full recorder/live/mpco sweep at 495 passing.

### ADDED — Spatial filters on every read-side composite ([#51])

Ergonomic spatial selection lands on every composite that returns
slabs:

| Filter | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `nearest_to(point, component=…)` | Single nearest entity to the query point |
| `in_box(box_min, box_max, …)` | Half-open on the upper side: `[box_min, box_max)` so adjacent boxes don't double-count shared faces. Use `np.inf` to relax an axis |
| `in_sphere(center, radius, …)` | Closed ball |
| `on_plane(point_on_plane, normal, tolerance, …)` | Absolute distance ≤ tolerance |

Available on `results.nodes` plus the six element-level composites
(`results.elements`, `.elements.gauss`, `.line_stations`, `.fibers`,
`.layers`, `.springs`) via the shared `_ElementGeometryMixin`.
Element-side queries use centroids computed lazily from the FEM's
node coordinates + per-type connectivity, robust to mixed-type
meshes.

- **Filters compose additively.** Spatial primitives intersect with
  each named selector (`pg=` / `label=` / `selection=` / `ids=` /
  `element_type=`) the same way:
  ```python
  results.nodes.in_box(
      (-1, -1, 0), (1, 1, 5),
      component="displacement_z", pg="Top",
  )
  ```
- **`element_type=` selector** on every element-level composite.
  Restricts the candidate set by broker element-type name
  (`"Tet4"`, `"Hex8"`, `"Quad4"`, etc.). Resolves via
  `fem.elements.types` and `fem.elements.resolve(element_type=…)`.
- **Verbose parameter names per project preference**: `point` (was
  `xyz`), `box_min` / `box_max` (was `p_min` / `p_max`), `center`,
  `radius`, `point_on_plane`, `normal`, `tolerance`.
- New user-facing guide:
  [`guide_results_filtering.md`](internal_docs/guide_results_filtering.md)
  — 12 sections covering the composite tree, selectors menu,
  geometric helpers, additive composition, slab shapes, time
  slicing, stage scoping, discovery API, worked recipes, pitfalls,
  and what's queued.
- 21 spatial tests + 18 existing composite tests pass.

### ADDED — Elastic-beam line-stations synthesis ([#47])

The Phase 11b live-capture path previously required a force- or
disp-based beam-column section.force probe; closed-form elastic
beams (`ElasticBeam{2d,3d}`, `ElasticTimoshenkoBeam{2d,3d}`,
`ModElasticBeam2d`) were silently dropped because they have no
integration points. The MPCO read path already synthesises a
2-station slab from the `localForce` bucket — this commit ports the
same synthesis to the live `DomainCapture` path.

- New `synthesize_line_station_layout_for_elastic_beam(class_name)`
  in [`solvers/_element_response.py`] — builds a 2-station
  `ResponseLayout` at ξ ∈ {-1, +1} for any class with a
  `NODAL_FORCE_CATALOG` entry, using canonical line-station
  component names. Companion
  `is_line_station_synthesis_catalogued` predicate.
- `_LineStationGroup` gains a `mode` field; `_probe_element` splits
  into `_probe_section_force` (existing) and
  `_probe_local_force_synthesis` (new).
- `_step_local_force` reads `ops.eleResponse(eid, "localForce")` once
  per step and applies the standard sign flip on station 2 so the
  slab matches section-force convention (mirrors the MPCO path).
- **Loud skip warning.** `DomainCapture.end_stage` now emits a single
  consolidated `UserWarning` if any elements were dropped from
  line-stations recording, listing the breakdown by reason and a
  sample of element IDs. Steers the user to MPCO or to rebuilding
  as `ForceBeamColumn` instead of letting the silent skip turn into
  a confusing empty diagram.
- `examples/EOS Examples/example_buckleUP_v2.ipynb` gains a
  `recs.line_stations(...)` call so its `elasticBeamColumn` braces /
  columns / beams produce a real line-stations slab the
  `LineForceDiagram` can render.

### ADDED — Recorder vocabulary discovery ([#50])

The recorder vocabulary is now discoverable from three surfaces, all
sharing one source of truth:

- **Method docstrings** on `Recorders.{nodes, elements, line_stations,
  gauss, fibers, layers, modal}` enumerate every canonical component,
  every shorthand expansion, the selector vocabulary, the cadence
  options, coverage caveats per execution strategy, and a worked
  example. mkdocstrings auto-renders these on
  [`api/opensees.md`](api/opensees.md), so the API page now shows
  the full menu.
- **Static introspection methods**:
  ```python
  Recorders.categories()
  Recorders.components_for(category)
  Recorders.shorthands_for(category)
  ```
  Useful at the REPL, in notebooks, for validation messages.
- **New reference page** at *Guides › Results › Recorder reference*
  ([`guide_recorders_reference.md`](internal_docs/guide_recorders_reference.md))
  — single-page menu with categories at a glance, shared selectors
  and cadence, then per-method tables of components and shorthands.
- 16 new introspection tests; full recorder sweep at 158 passing.

### DOCS — 6-card landing, grouped nav, examples gallery ([#49], [#52], [#44], [`affa81d`])

- **6-card landing** ([#49]) replaces the 2-card grid on
  the docs home page. Cards are organised by user
  intent: First steps, Quickstart & Examples, Build a model, Run &
  read results, Architecture, API reference. Plus a 3-card
  "What's new" band.
- **Grouped navigation** ([#49]). `mkdocs.yml` reorganises the
  bloated Guides and Architecture sections into collapsible
  sub-headings: *Getting started* / *Building models* / *Physics* /
  *Solver bridge* / *Results* / *Reference* under Guides;
  *Foundations* / *Subsystems* / *Gmsh background* under
  Architecture. No content moves.
- **Curated examples gallery** ([#49]) — 8 EOS notebooks rendered
  inline via mkdocs-jupyter at `/examples/notebooks/<name>/`.
  `docs/_hooks.py` copies notebooks from `examples/EOS Examples/`
  to `docs/examples/notebooks/` on every build (mtime-aware so
  incremental rebuilds are fast); source of truth stays in
  `examples/EOS Examples/`.
- **8 hero notebooks modernised** ([#52]) — single-flow
  apeGmsh-Results pedagogical template:
  1. Imports + parameters
  2. Geometry (apeGmsh)
  3. Physical groups
  4. Mesh
  5. OpenSees model — vanilla openseespy
  6. Declare recorders — apeGmsh
  7. Run analysis with `spec.capture(...)` *or*
     `spec.emit_recorders(...)`
  8. Read results back via `Results`
  9. Plot in-notebook
  10. Optional viewer (subprocess, `APEGMSH_SKIP_VIEWER` honoured)

  Strategy assignments mixed across the curriculum:
  `01_hello_plate`, `04_portal_frame_2D`, `05_labels_and_pgs`,
  `12_interface_tie`, `17_modal_analysis`, `19_pushover_elastoplastic`
  use `spec.capture`; `02_cantilever_beam_2D`, `10b_part_assembly`
  use `spec.emit_recorders`. All 8 verified end-to-end via
  `nbconvert --execute` against closed-form solutions.
- **Gallery page refresh** (`affa81d`). Each card calls out the
  strategy used (`spec.capture` vs `spec.emit_recorders`), names the
  verification target, and points at the specific pedagogical
  moment that notebook teaches that others don't. New "Common
  shape across every notebook" section makes the unified template
  visible at the gallery level.
- **31 EOS notebooks wired** ([#44]) with a "Capture results"
  section before `g.end()`, providing two pedagogical paths:
  manual `NativeWriter` and declarative
  `Recorders().nodes(...) → DomainCapture` context. New
  `scripts/wire_eos_notebook.py` (auto-wiring) and
  `scripts/migrate_eos_legacy_api.py` (API-drift migrator) for
  future notebooks. Both paths gate the viewer launch on
  `APEGMSH_SKIP_VIEWER` for headless / nbconvert / CI runs.
  Notebooks with pre-existing breakage moved to `to_review/` with a
  README explaining each.

## v1.2.0 — Results viewer: Gauss contour, scrubber animation, shape-function catalog

Six PRs landing on top of v1.1.0's Results rebuild. `ContourDiagram`
gains two new rendering paths so element-level Gauss data flows
straight through the dialog → diagram → substrate pipeline; the time
scrubber gets real Play / FPS / loop controls; the shape-function
catalog grows from 5 to 12 element types so quadratic and prism
meshes are first-class. **All 6 PRs merged green** — 377 viewer
tests + 1876 non-viewer tests pass on main.

PRs in this release: [#35], [#36], [#37], [#38], [#39], [#42].

### ADDED — `ContourDiagram` Gauss paths

- **Element-constant Gauss contour** ([#37]). New `gauss_cell` rendering
  path activated when `n_gp == 1` per element (CST / tri31, hex8 with
  one-point integration, etc.). Reads via
  `results.elements.gauss.get(component=...)`, paints `cell_data` on
  a substrate submesh extracted by element IDs. Removes the manual
  nodal-averaging step the plate notebook was using.
- **GP→nodal extrapolation for higher-order integration** ([#39]).
  New `gauss_node` path activated when `n_gp > 1`. The slab is
  projected onto the linear-corner shape functions via the
  Moore–Penrose pseudo-inverse (`pinv(N)`), then accumulated into a
  per-node sum + count for cross-element averaging. New module
  [`apeGmsh.results._gauss_extrapolation`] with two public entry
  points: `extrapolate_gauss_slab_to_nodes(slab, fem)` and
  `per_element_max_gp_count(slab)`.
- **`ContourStyle.topology` field** ([#37]). User-facing knob with
  three values:
    * `"auto"` (default) — prefer nodal data when both composites have
      the requested component; fall through to Gauss otherwise.
    * `"nodes"` — force the nodal-scalar path (point data).
    * `"gauss"` — force the Gauss path; cell-vs-node sub-decision is
      made internally based on `n_gp`.
- **Topology dropdown in the Add Diagram dialog** ([#38]). Visible
  only when the selected kind is Contour. The Component combo
  populates from the union of nodes + gauss components under
  `"auto"`, and from the picked composite under `"nodes"` / `"gauss"`.

### ADDED — Time scrubber animation ([#36])

- **Play button** drives a `QTimer` at `1000 / fps` ms; each tick
  advances one step via `director.set_step(...)`. The scrubber stays
  slider-passive — it only updates the slider via the Director's
  `on_step_changed` callback, never directly.
- **FPS spinner** (1–60, default 30). Live — changing it while
  playing updates the timer interval without disturbing the run.
- **Loop modes** combo: `"once"` (stop at last step), `"loop"`
  (wrap to step 0), `"bounce"` (reverse direction at boundaries,
  never wraps).
- **Stops on stage change** automatically; a fresh stage may have
  a different step count, so the scrubber refreshes and waits for
  the user to press Play again.

### ADDED — Shape-function catalog expansion ([#42])

`SHAPE_FUNCTIONS_BY_GMSH_CODE` grows from 5 entries to 12. New types
covering everything you'd hit by setting
`gmsh.model.mesh.setOrder(2)` plus `wedge6` for extruded / layered
meshes:

| Code | Type   | Notes                                          |
|------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| 6    | wedge6 | Linear prism (tri × line tensor product)       |
| 9    | tri6   | Quadratic triangle                             |
| 10   | quad9  | Lagrangian biquadratic quad                    |
| 11   | tet10  | Quadratic tet                                  |
| 12   | hex27  | Lagrangian triquadratic hex                    |
| 16   | quad8  | Serendipity quadratic quad                     |
| 17   | hex20  | Serendipity quadratic hex                      |

Node orderings match Gmsh's published convention (cross-checked
against the ASCII diagrams in `gmsh-4.15.1/src/geo/M{Triangle,
Quadrangle,Tetrahedron,Hexahedron,Prism}.h`), so a connectivity row
read straight from a Gmsh-generated mesh works without any
reordering. Pyramids (`pyr5` / `pyr14`) and `line3` are deliberately
out of scope — pyramids have a known apex singularity worth avoiding
for a first pass, and `line3` is rare in OpenSees output.

For GP→nodal extrapolation the higher-order types fall back to
their **linear counterpart** (tri6 → tri3, quad8/9 → quad4,
tet10 → tet4, hex20/27 → hex8). Reasons: the substrate is built
from linear cells (mid-side / face / center nodes are dropped in
`build_fem_scene`), so non-corner extrapolations are never painted;
and `pinv` on the full higher-order N matrix produces a
non-constant nodal field for a constant GP input
(minimum-norm regularization of the under-determined system),
which is wrong for visualization.

### REFACTORED — single-source diagram topology routing ([#35])

- New `Diagram.topology: str` class attribute; each subclass declares
  it next to `kind`. The Add Diagram dialog's `_KIND_TO_TOPOLOGY`
  table is now derived from those attributes:
  ```python
  _KIND_TO_TOPOLOGY = {
      entry.kind_id: entry.diagram_class.topology for entry in _KINDS
  }
  ```
  Previously the dict was hand-maintained alongside the per-class
  composite-reader calls and could drift.

### CHANGED — `ContourDiagram` internals

- Three internal effective-topology values replace the previous two:
  `"nodes"` / `"gauss_cell"` / `"gauss_node"`. Dispatch is decided
  at attach time after a single step-0 read used both for the n_gp
  probe and the initial scatter.
- Cross-element discontinuities are smoothed by the nodal averaging
  in the `gauss_node` path. Standard post-processor behaviour
  (STKO, ParaView). A future per-element subdivision path can
  preserve discontinuities — out of scope here, the `gauss_cell`
  scaffolding stays in place to keep that door open.

### Test coverage

### Known follow-ups (not scheduled)

- **Discontinuity-preserving Gauss contour** — subdivides each
  multi-GP element into linear sub-cells, samples at sub-vertices,
  renders cell-data per sub-cell. Preserves jumps at material
  interfaces. ~500–800 LOC, design-discussion-first decision.
- **Hex27 face/center node ordering** — verified self-consistent in
  the shape-function math, but the assumed Gmsh ordering for nodes
  20–26 isn't independently validated against a real Gmsh hex27
  mesh. One-row fix in `_HEX27_LAGRANGE_INDEX` if a real mesh
  surfaces a mismatch.
- **Pyramid shape functions** — `pyr5` and `pyr14`. Add when needed.

## v1.1.0 — Results: backend-agnostic FEM post-processing system rebuild

Wholesale rebuild of the `apeGmsh.results` module. The legacy
in-memory `Results` carrier (a thin VTK-feeder bound to live numpy
arrays) is replaced by a lazy disk-backed reader plus a unified
composite API that mirrors `FEMData`. Recording flows through three
execution strategies — Tcl/Py recorders, in-process domain capture,
and an MPCO bridge — all driven by one declarative
`g.opensees.recorders` spec. **987 tests pass** end-to-end including
the El Ladruno OpenSees Tcl subprocess integration. See PR #12 and
`internal_docs/Results_architecture.md` for full design.

### ADDED — `apeGmsh.results`

- **Native HDF5 schema + I/O.** `NativeWriter` / `NativeReader`
  round-trip nodes, Gauss points, fibers, layers, line stations, and
  per-element forces. Stages are first-class (`kind="transient"` /
  `"static"` / `"mode"`). Multi-partition stitching transparent to
  the reader. Embedded FEMData snapshot in `/model/` — including
  `MeshSelectionStore` — so result files are self-contained.
- **`Results` composite class** mirroring `FEMData`. Selection
  vocabulary `pg=` / `label=` / `selection=` / `ids=`. Stage scoping
  via `results.stage(name)`; mode access via `results.modes`.
  Soft FEM coupling with hash-validated `bind()`.
- **`compute_snapshot_id(fem)`** deterministic content hash —
  ties recorder specs ↔ result files ↔ FEMData snapshots.
- **MPCO reader.** `Results.from_mpco(path)` reads existing STKO
  `.mpco` files through the same composite API. Partial FEMData
  synthesis from MPCO `MODEL/` group (nodes + elements +
  region-derived PGs).
- **`g.opensees.recorders`** declarative spec composite.
  Standalone class, no parent ref, no gmsh dependency. `.nodes`,
  `.elements`, `.line_stations`, `.gauss`, `.fibers`, `.layers`,
  `.modal` declaration methods. `spec.resolve(fem, ndm, ndf)`
  expands shorthand components, validates per category, locks
  `fem_snapshot_id`.
- **Three execution strategies driven by the spec:**
  - **Strategy A** — `g.opensees.export.tcl/py(..., recorders=spec)`
    emits `recorder Node/Element ...` commands + HDF5 manifest
    sidecar. `Results.from_recorders(spec, output_dir, fem=fem)`
    parses output `.out` files into native HDF5 with a cache layer
    at `<project_root>/results/`.
  - **Strategy B** — `with spec.capture(path, fem) as cap:` wraps
    an openseespy analyze loop, querying `ops.nodeDisp` etc. per
    record. Multi-record merge with NaN-fill when records target
    disjoint node sets. `cap.capture_modes()` writes one mode-kind
    stage per `ops.eigen` mode.
  - **Strategy C** — `recorders_file_format="mpco"` dispatches to
    a single `recorder mpco` line aggregating all records.
    Validated via subprocess against the El Ladruno OpenSees Tcl
    build.
- **Element capability flags** on `_ElemSpec`: `has_gauss`,
  `has_fibers`, `has_layers`, `has_line_stations` plus a
  `supports(category)` helper. All 16 entries in `_ELEM_REGISTRY`
  annotated.
- **`MeshSelectionStore`** name-based lookups: `names()`,
  `node_ids(name)`, `element_ids(name)` — mirrors
  `PhysicalGroupSet`'s API.
- **Architecture doc** `internal_docs/Results_architecture.md`
  (single canonical reference).

### CHANGED — Results module API (BREAKING)

- **`Results.from_fem(fem, point_data=..., cell_data=...)` removed.**
  Use `Results.from_native(...)`, `from_mpco(...)`,
  `from_recorders(...)`, or hand-construct via `NativeWriter` for
  the in-memory case.
- **`fem.viewer()`** raises `NotImplementedError` until the viewer
  rebuild project. The new flow will go through the rebuilt
  composite API.
- **`g.mesh.viewer(point_data=..., cell_data=...)`** raises
  `NotImplementedError`. The mesh-only paths (`g.mesh.viewer()` and
  `g.mesh.viewer(results=path)` for a `.vtu`/`.pvd` file) still
  work unchanged.
- **Public exports** under `apeGmsh.results`: `Results`,
  `ResultsReader`, `NativeReader`, `MPCOReader`, `ResultLevel`,
  `StageInfo`, `BindError`, and the slab dataclasses
  (`NodeSlab`, `ElementSlab`, `LineStationSlab`, `GaussSlab`,
  `FiberSlab`, `LayerSlab`).

### DEFERRED — element-level transcoding

Element-level records (`gauss` / `fibers` / `layers` /
`line_stations` / `elements`) work end-to-end on the **declaration
and emission** side. The **read/decode** side is stubbed:

- `MPCOReader.read_gauss/fibers/layers/...` returns empty slabs.
- `RecorderTranscoder` skips element records silently.
- `DomainCapture.step()` raises `NotImplementedError` for element
  categories.

All three need the same missing piece: a per-element-class
response-metadata catalog. Plan in
`internal_docs/plan_element_transcoding.md` (Phase 11a).
**Nodal results work everywhere today.**

### NEW FIXTURE

- `tests/fixtures/results/elasticFrame.mpco` — 400 KB binary,
  12 nodes / 11 elastic frame elements / 10 transient steps /
  2 model stages. Used by the MPCO reader + integration tests.

## v1.0.9 — Viewer: higher-order rendering + filter overhaul (WIP)

Lands the viewer fixes and refactor scaffolding from PR #11.  Higher-
order elements (Q8/Q9, Tri6, Tet10, etc.) no longer render as VTK's
sub-triangle tessellation fans.  The dim filter actually hides actors
now, and node display scopes to the dim filter.  Step 5 (corner /
midside / bubble node differentiation) is deferred to the next release.

### FIXED — viewer

- **Q9 / higher-order surface fill** — the fill layer is now built from
  linearized corner-only cells (`mesh_scene.GMSH_LINEAR`), so a Q9 quad
  renders as a single quad and a Tri6 as a single triangle.  31 element
  types covered including P3 / P4 and bubble variants; unknown types
  warn instead of being silently dropped.
- **Dim filter (1D/2D/3D checkboxes)** — was overridden in
  `mesh_viewer._on_mesh_filter` setup so it only set the pick mask;
  now also flips fill / wire / node-cloud actor visibility per dim.
- **Phantom wireframe on Reveal** — `VisibilityManager._rebuild_actors`
  now rebuilds the wire actor alongside the fill on hide / reveal, so
  hidden entities lose their edges and revealed entities regain them.
- **BRep surface fill for higher-order meshes** — `brep_scene` got the
  same linearization treatment for Tri6 / Quad8 / Quad9.

### CHANGED — viewer

- New **wireframe layer** built via `extract_all_edges()` per dim>=2,
  registered as `EntityRegistry.dim_wire_actors`.  Replaces VTK's
  built-in `show_edges` (which rendered the higher-order cell
  tessellation, not the FE element boundary).  Clipping plane,
  visibility manager, and dim filter all participate.
- **Per-dim node clouds** — single global `node_actor` replaced by
  `EntityRegistry.dim_node_actors` keyed by dim, each containing the
  nodes used by entities of that dim (with `includeBoundary=True`).
  The dim filter now scopes node display: unchecking 1D drops 1D-only
  nodes, but boundary nodes shared with a visible 2D dim stay.
- **Tree right-click Hide / Isolate / Reveal-all** — added to BRep
  `SelectionTreePanel` and `BrowserTab` (group + entity rows).  Backed
  by new `VisibilityManager.hide_dts(dts)` / `isolate_dts(dts)`
  programmatic counterparts of the pick-driven `hide()` / `isolate()`.

### ADDED — `viewers.core.visibility` doc

- Spelled out the **filter state model** in the module docstring:
  cosmetic dim toggle (`SetVisibility`), entity hide
  (`VisibilityManager._hidden`), and clipping (render-time) are three
  independent layers, intentionally not unified.

## v1.0.8 — Embedded-node constraint resolver (`ASDEmbeddedNodeElement`)

Closes Phase 11b.  Replaces the `NotImplementedError` on
`ConstraintsComposite._resolve_embedded` with a working resolver, so
embedded-rebar and similar non-conforming inclusions can be expressed
without fragmenting the host mesh.

### ADDED — `solvers/_constraint_resolver.py`

- `_barycentric_tri3(p, p0, p1, p2)` — barycentric coordinates of `p`
  inside a 2D triangle, with projection onto the triangle's plane for
  off-plane points.
- `_barycentric_tet4(p, p0, p1, p2, p3)` — same for a 3D tetrahedron.
- `ConstraintResolver.resolve_embedded(...)` — given embedded nodes and
  host element connectivity, locates each embedded node in its host
  via KD-tree spatial indexing + barycentric coordinates, then emits
  `InterpolationRecord` shape-function couplings that match
  `ASDEmbeddedNodeElement` kinematics.

### ADDED — integration

- `ConstraintsComposite._resolve_embedded` now dispatches to the new
  resolver, collects host element connectivity from a labeled master
  region (tri3 / tet4), filters out embedded nodes that coincide with
  host corners, and returns the coupling records.
- `examples/EOS Examples/15_embedded_rebar.py` rewritten to use the
  embedded path instead of the old fragment-based conformal rebar.

### ADDED — tests

- `tests/test_constraint_resolver.py` — 4 cases (tri3 interior + corner,
  tet4 centroid, multi-element search).

### ADDED — regression coverage

- `tests/test_target_resolution.py` — locks in `FEMData.nodes.get()` /
  `.elements.get()` `target=` precedence (`label > PG`) and raw
  `[(dim, tag)]` passthrough.
- `tests/test_boolean_ops.py` — guards the 2D `fragment(cleanup_free=True)`
  bug so it can't regress.
- `tests/test_parts_advanced.py` — covers `g.parts.add(part, label=...,
  translate=...)` on an unlabeled Part (no sidecar).

### ADDED — infrastructure

- `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with
  `pythonpath = ["src"]`, so pytest run from a worktree picks up the
  worktree's source instead of the editable install pointing at the
  main checkout.

---

## v1.0.7 — Selection upgrades + `set_transfinite_box`

Polish pass on the v1.0.6 selection API.  Eliminates the hand-rolled
patterns that kept showing up in scripts (two-step boundary queries,
`_apply_hex` helpers, manual node-count-by-axis loops) and adds the
predicates and combinators users were reaching for.

### ADDED — boundary helpers

- `g.model.queries.boundary_curves(tag)` — returns every unique
  curve on the boundary of an entity.  Encapsulates the two-step
  query (faces → individual face boundaries with `combined=False` →
  deduplicate) that's needed because Gmsh's `getBoundary(vol,
  recursive=True)` skips dim=1 and goes straight to vertices.
  Accepts a label, PG name, int tag, dimtag, or list of any.
- `g.model.queries.boundary_points(tag)` — symmetric helper for
  the eight corner points of a volume.

### ADDED — `select()` upgrades

- `select()` now accepts a label string with a `dim=` keyword:
  `select('box', dim=2, on={'z': 0})` resolves the label, walks
  to dim 2, and applies the predicate — no manual `boundary()`
  call beforehand.
- `not_on=` and `not_crossing=` negation predicates.  Same
  signed-distance computation as the positive forms; useful for
  *all faces except the bottom* style queries.
- The `Selection.to_label()` call on a mixed-dim selection no
  longer triggers the labels-composite collision warning — using
  the same name across multiple dims is the documented intent
  here.

### ADDED — `Selection` ergonomics

- Set operations: `selection | other` (union with deduplication),
  `selection & other` (intersection), `selection - other`
  (difference).  All three preserve the back-reference to
  `_Queries` so chaining keeps working.
- `selection.partition_by(axis=None)` groups entities by their
  dominant bounding-box axis.  Returns a `dict[str, Selection]`
  keyed by `'x'`, `'y'`, `'z'`, or — if `axis=` is given — a
  single `Selection`.  Semantics are dim-aware:
  - **curves** group by the *largest* extent (curve direction);
  - **surfaces** group by the *smallest* extent (perpendicular /
    normal direction).

### ADDED — primitive factories

- `g.model.queries.plane(z=0)`, `plane(p1, p2, p3)`, and
  `plane(normal=..., through=...)` build a `Plane` you can pass to
  any `select(on=..., crossing=...)` call (positive or negated).
- `g.model.queries.line(p1, p2)` builds a `Line`.
- Define a primitive once, reuse across many selections — useful
  when the same cutting plane appears in several queries.

### ADDED — `set_transfinite_box`

- `g.mesh.structured.set_transfinite_box(vol, *, size=None, n=None,
  recombine=True)` — collapses the full transfinite-hex setup
  (curve node counts, face transfinite + recombine, volume
  transfinite) into a single call.  Accepts either `size=` (target
  element size; node counts derived per edge from
  `round(length / size) + 1`) or `n=` (uniform node count per
  edge).  Pass `recombine=False` for a transfinite tet mesh
  instead of hex.

### CHANGED

- `examples/EOS Examples/22_geometric_selection.ipynb` rewrites
  the 3-D section to use `set_transfinite_box`,
  `select('box', dim=2, ...)`, the `plane()` factory,
  `not_on=`, set operations, `partition_by`, and chained
  `to_label / to_physical` — every v1.0.7 feature is exercised.

### FIXED

- `g.model.queries.bounding_box(tag, dim=N)`,
  `center_of_mass(tag, dim=N)`, and `mass(tag, dim=N)` now honour
  `dim` as an explicit hint when ``tag`` is a bare integer.
  Previously these went through `resolve_to_single_dimtag` →
  `resolve_dim`, which always searches dimensions 3 → 0 and
  returns the first match — so on a model containing both volume
  1 and curve 1, `bounding_box(1, dim=1)` silently returned the
  volume's bounding box.  Bare ints are now passed straight to
  the corresponding Gmsh OCC call at the requested dim.  String
  labels and `(dim, tag)` tuples still go through resolution.
- `g.model.geometry.slice` now passes its plane reference as an
  explicit `(2, plane_tag)` dimtag to the downstream
  `cut_by_surface` / `cut_by_plane` calls.  Previously it passed
  a bare int, which triggered `resolve_dim` to scan the live
  Gmsh model — and because `add_axis_cutting_plane` is called
  with `sync=False`, the new plane wasn't yet visible to
  `getEntities(2)`, causing the resolver to fall through to the
  curves and fail with `"surface ref N resolved to dim=1"`.
  Together these two fixes recover ≈14 previously-failing tests
  in `test_geometry_cutting`, `test_sections`, and
  `test_part_anchors`.

### INTERNAL

- New `_Queries._resolve_to_dimtags(tag)` helper consolidates the
  string / int / dimtag resolution path used by `boundary_curves`,
  `boundary_points`, and the new `select()` label-string branch.
- `_select_impl` now takes `not_on` / `not_crossing` and inverts
  the predicate result (`hit ^ invert`).  The four kwargs are
  mutually exclusive — exactly one must be passed.
- `Selection` is parameterised on `DimTag` (a `tuple[int, int]`
  alias).  Method signatures use proper type hints throughout.
- 29 new test cases in `tests/test_selection.py` covering the new
  helpers, the negation predicates, set operations, `partition_by`
  for both curves and surfaces, the primitive factories, and
  `set_transfinite_box`.  Total: 55 cases passing.

---

## v1.0.6 — Geometric selection API (`g.model.queries.select`)

### ADDED

- `g.model.queries.select(entities, on=..., crossing=...)` filters
  curves, surfaces, or volumes by a geometric predicate. Replaces
  the noisy `entities_in_bounding_box(xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax)`
  pattern with a readable description of *what* you want.
- Predicates work on the bounding-box corners of each candidate:
  - `on=` — every corner within `tol` of the primitive (entity lies
    on it).
  - `crossing=` — corners exist on both sides of the primitive
    (entity straddles it). Same signed-distance computation
    underlies both.
- Primitive formats — no imports needed:
  - `{'z': 0}` → axis-aligned plane z = 0.
  - `[(p1), (p2)]` (2 points) → infinite line, for cutting 2-D
    geometry.
  - `[(p1), (p2), (p3)]` (3 points) → infinite plane through 3
    non-collinear points. Use for surfaces and volumes.
- `select()` returns a `Selection` — a `list` subclass with three
  chainable methods:
  - `.select(...)` — filter further (AND logic when stacked).
  - `.to_label(name)` — register every entity as a label, grouped
    by dimension.
  - `.to_physical(name)` — register every entity as a physical
    group, grouped by dimension.
  Each returns `self` so you can keep chaining: `select → label →
  select again → physical`.
- `Selection.__repr__` describes the count by dimension and reminds
  the user how to chain — IDE autocomplete + the repr are the only
  discovery surface needed.
- New curriculum notebook
  `examples/EOS Examples/22_geometric_selection.ipynb` walks the
  full workflow: predicate intro → stacking → unstructured baseline
  → transfinite quad mesh of a plate → 3-D hex of a box.
- Companion script
  `examples/example_unstructured_and_transfinite.py` shows the
  unstructured-vs-transfinite contrast for two adjacent boxes.
- API docs page extended at `docs/api/model.md` with `Selection`,
  `Plane`, and `Line` (the latter two documented as internal but
  exposed so the format reference is auto-generated from
  docstrings).

### INTERNAL

- New module `src/apeGmsh/core/_selection.py` holds `Plane`, `Line`,
  the `_parse_primitive` dispatcher, the `_select_impl` core, and
  the `Selection` class. `Plane` and `Line` are not part of the
  public API — they are only constructed by `_parse_primitive` from
  raw user input passed to `select()`.
- `Selection` carries a back-reference to the originating `_Queries`
  so `.select()`, `.to_label()`, and `.to_physical()` can route to
  the session's `labels` / `physical` composites without the user
  having to thread context.
- Tests in `tests/test_selection.py` (26 cases) cover predicates in
  2-D and 3-D, primitive parsing (including degenerate / collinear /
  coincident input), the Selection chain, label / PG registration
  for both single-dim and mixed-dim selections, and error paths.

---

## v1.0.5 — Line loads with `normal=True` (radial / curve-perpendicular pressure)

### ADDED

- `g.loads.line(..., normal=True)` applies a pressure perpendicular
  to each edge instead of along a fixed direction.  Useful for
  internal/external pressure on curved 2-D boundaries (Lamé-style
  problems, fluid-loaded arcs, etc.) where the cartesian direction
  varies along the curve.
- Default sign comes from Gmsh's surface boundary orientation —
  `gmsh.model.getBoundary([(2, surface)], oriented=True)` tells the
  composite which side of the curve the structure sits on, so
  `magnitude > 0` always pushes *into* the structure (matching
  `g.loads.surface(..., normal=True)`).
- Optional `away_from=(x0, y0, z0)` reference point overrides the
  Gmsh path — flips the in-plane normal so it points away from that
  point.  Use for ambiguous cases (a curve bounding two surfaces, or
  a free curve not bounding any surface) or when you want to be
  explicit.
- Both `reduction="tributary"` (default) and `reduction="consistent"`
  honour `normal=True`.
- New worked example
  `examples/EOS Examples/example_plate_pyGmsh_v2.ipynb` rewrites the
  thick-walled-cylinder Lamé problem on top of the new API —
  replaces ~30 lines of manual consistent-force integration on the
  inner arc with a single `g.loads.line(pg='Pressure', magnitude=p,
  normal=True)` declaration.

### INTERNAL

- New resolver methods `LoadResolver.resolve_line_per_edge_tributary`
  and `resolve_line_per_edge_consistent` accept a list of
  `(edge, q_xyz)` items so the composite can pre-compute per-edge
  force-per-length vectors (which vary along curved boundaries).
  Constant-direction line loads still use the original
  `resolve_line_*` methods unchanged.
- Per-edge normal computation lives in `LoadsComposite` (it needs
  Gmsh queries for the boundary-orientation path); the resolver
  stays pure-math.

---

## v1.0.4 — Low-level booleans preserve Instances + accept label/PG refs

### FIXED

- `g.model.boolean.{fuse,cut,intersect,fragment}` now keep
  `Instance.entities` consistent when called directly on tags that
  happen to belong to a tracked Instance.  Previously the remap only
  ran inside `g.parts.fragment_all` / `fragment_pair` / `fuse_group`,
  so a low-level boolean left Instance entries pointing at consumed
  tags.  The remap-from-result walk has been extracted into
  `PartsRegistry._remap_from_result` and every OCC boolean call site
  (both `_bool_op` and the Parts-level methods) now routes through
  that single implementation.

### ADDED

- `g.model.boolean.*` accepts label names and user physical-group
  names in `objects=` / `tools=`, matching the input shape of
  `g.physical.add`.  Strings resolve via the shared resolver: label
  (Tier 1) first, then user PG (Tier 2).  Raw tags, dimtags, and
  mixed lists still work.

### INTERNAL

- New `resolve_to_dimtags` helper in `apeGmsh.core._helpers` —
  companion to `resolve_to_tags` that emits `(dim, tag)` pairs.
  Handles labels / PGs that span multiple dimensions without the
  caller having to coerce a single dim.
- Plan B (`Instance.entities` as a computed label-backed property)
  was weighed against this conservative fix and deferred; see
  `internal_docs/plan_instance_computed_view.md` for the signals that
  would trigger revisiting it.

---

## v1.0.0 — Clean Architecture (breaking)

v1.0 bundles two breaking changes: the package rename and the Model
composition refactor. A full find-replace migration guide is at
[`internal_docs/MIGRATION_v1.md`](internal_docs/MIGRATION_v1.md).

### BREAKING

- **Package renamed**: `pyGmsh` → `apeGmsh`
  - `from pyGmsh import pyGmsh` → `from apeGmsh import apeGmsh`
  - `class pyGmsh(_SessionBase)` → `class apeGmsh(_SessionBase)`
  - Companion app `apeGmshViewer` keeps its name (only its internal
    imports of our theme module were updated)

- **Model methods split into five sub-composites** (composition replaces
  mixin inheritance):
  - `g.model.geometry.*` — 19 primitive builders (add_point, add_line,
    add_box, add_cylinder, etc.)
  - `g.model.boolean.*` — fuse, cut, intersect, fragment
  - `g.model.transforms.*` — translate, rotate, scale, mirror, copy,
    extrude, revolve, sweep, thru_sections
  - `g.model.io.*` — load/save STEP, IGES, DXF, MSH, heal_shapes
  - `g.model.queries.*` — bounding_box, center_of_mass, mass, boundary,
    adjacencies, entities_in_bounding_box, remove, remove_duplicates,
    make_conformal, registry
  - `g.model.sync()`, `g.model.viewer()`, `g.model.gui()`,
    `g.model.launch_picker()`, `g.model.selection` stay flat on Model

- **Rename `g.mass` → `g.masses`** for consistency with the other
  plural composites (`g.loads`, `g.parts`, `g.physical`, `g.constraints`,
  `g.mesh_selection`)
  - `fem.mass` → `fem.masses`
  - Class names (`MassesComposite`, `MassSet`, `MassDef`, `MassRecord`)
    unchanged

- **Removed legacy aliases**:
  - `g.initialize()` / `g.finalize()` → use `g.begin()` / `g.end()`
  - `g._initialized` → use `g.is_active`
  - `g.model_name` → use `g.name`

- **Removed deprecated methods**:
  - `g.model.viewer_fast()` / `g.mesh.viewer_fast()` → use `viewer()`
    (always fast now)
  - `g.parts.add_physical_groups()` → explicit
    `g.physical.add_volume(inst.entities[3], name=...)`
  - `g.opensees.add_nodal_load()` → use `g.loads.point()` in a
    `g.loads.pattern()` block
  - `g.mesh_selection.add_nodes(nearest_to=...)` → `closest_to=`

- **Removed convenience delegates on the session**:
  - `g.remove_duplicates()` → `g.model.queries.remove_duplicates()`
  - `g.make_conformal()` → `g.model.queries.make_conformal()`

- **Removed property on `_SessionBase`**:
  - `_parent.model_name` → `_parent.name`

### FIXED

- Pylance / static analyzers no longer lose track of Model methods.
  Composition makes every method statically discoverable through
  the sub-composite classes (`_Geometry`, `_Boolean`, `_Transforms`,
  `_IO`, `_Queries`), each of which is a concrete class with explicit
  methods. No MRO walking across 5 mixin files.

### INTERNAL

- `_GeometryMixin` → `_Geometry`
- `_BooleanMixin` → `_Boolean`
- `_TransformsMixin` → `_Transforms`
- `_IOMixin` → `_IO`
- `_QueriesMixin` → `_Queries`

Each sub-composite now takes a `model` reference in `__init__` and
accesses Model state via `self._model._log(...)`,
`self._model._register(...)`, `self._model._as_dimtags(...)`,
`self._model._registry`, instead of inheriting state.

### MIGRATION

See [`internal_docs/MIGRATION_v1.md`](internal_docs/MIGRATION_v1.md) for the complete
find-replace table and an automated migration script.

**v0.3.0** is the last `pyGmsh` release (pre-rename safety tag).
**v0.3.1** is the transitional `apeGmsh` release (rename only).
**v1.0.0** is the new architecture (composition + cleanups).

---

## v0.3.1 — Package rename (transitional)

- Renamed `pyGmsh` package directory to `apeGmsh/` on disk
- All internal imports, class name, config entries updated
- Examples and docs still reference old API (deferred to v1.0)
- Safety release — rename is isolated from the architectural
  refactor that follows in v1.0

## v0.3.0 — Last pyGmsh release (safety tag)

Safety checkpoint before the package rename and v1.0 refactor. This
is the final tag under the `pyGmsh` name. If you need the old API,
pin to this version.

---

## v0.2.x — Loads, Masses, Viewer overlays

- New `g.loads` composite with pattern context managers
- New `g.mass` composite (renamed to `g.masses` in v1.0)
- `fem.loads` / `fem.mass` auto-resolved by `get_fem_data()`
- Loads/masses/constraints overlays live on `g.mesh.viewer(fem=...)` —
  they are mesh-resolved concepts and never landed on `g.model.viewer()`

## v0.2.0 — Composites architecture

- Assembly absorbed into `apeGmsh` as composites:
  - `g.parts` (PartsRegistry)
  - `g.constraints` (ConstraintsComposite)
- MeshSelectionSet + \_mesh\_filters spatial query engine
- Viewer rebuild: BRep / mesh viewers unified around EntityRegistry,
  PickEngine, ColorManager, VisibilityManager
- Catppuccin Mocha theme across all viewers
